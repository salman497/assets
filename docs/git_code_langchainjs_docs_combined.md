# Community navigator

Hi! Thanks for being here. We're lucky to have a community of so many passionate developers building with LangChain–we have so much to teach and learn from each other. Community members contribute code, host meetups, write blog posts, amplify each other's work, become each other's customers and collaborators, and so much more.

Whether you're new to LangChain, looking to go deeper, or just want to get more exposure to the world of building with LLMs, this page can point you in the right direction.

- **🦜 Contribute to LangChain**

- **🌍 Meetups, Events, and Hackathons**

- **📣 Help Us Amplify Your Work**

- **💬 Stay in the loop**

# 🦜 Contribute to LangChain

LangChain is the product of over 5,000+ contributions by 1,500+ contributors, and there is **still** so much to do together. Here are some ways to get involved:

- **[Open a pull request](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/issues):** we'd appreciate all forms of contributions–new features, infrastructure improvements, better documentation, bug fixes, etc. If you have an improvement or an idea, we'd love to work on it with you.
- **[Read our contributor guidelines:](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** We ask contributors to follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow, run a few local checks for formatting, linting, and testing before submitting, and follow certain documentation and testing conventions.
- **Become an expert:** our experts help the community by answering product questions in Discord. If that's a role you'd like to play, we'd be so grateful! (And we have some special experts-only goodies/perks we can tell you more about). Send us an email to introduce yourself at hello@langchain.dev and we'll take it from there!
- **Integrate with LangChain:** if your product integrates with LangChain–or aspires to–we want to help make sure the experience is as smooth as possible for you and end users. Send us an email at hello@langchain.dev and tell us what you're working on.
 - **Become an Integration Maintainer:** Partner with our team to ensure your integration stays up-to-date and talk directly with users (and answer their inquiries) in our Discord. Introduce yourself at hello@langchain.dev if you'd like to explore this role.

# 🌍 Meetups, Events, and Hackathons

One of our favorite things about working in AI is how much enthusiasm there is for building together. We want to help make that as easy and impactful for you as possible!

- **Find a meetup, hackathon, or webinar:** you can find the one for you on on our [global events calendar](https://mirror-feeling-d80.notion.site/0bc81da76a184297b86ca8fc782ee9a3?v=0d80342540df465396546976a50cfb3f).
 - **Submit an event to our calendar:** email us at events@langchain.dev with a link to your event page! We can also help you spread the word with our local communities.
- **Host a meetup:** If you want to bring a group of builders together, we want to help! We can publicize your event on our event calendar/Twitter, share with our local communities in Discord, send swag, or potentially hook you up with a sponsor. Email us at events@langchain.dev to tell us about your event!
- **Become a meetup sponsor:** we often hear from groups of builders that want to get together, but are blocked or limited on some dimension (space to host, budget for snacks, prizes to distribute, etc.). If you'd like to help, send us an email to events@langchain.dev we can share more about how it works!
- **Speak at an event:** meetup hosts are always looking for great speakers, presenters, and panelists. If you'd like to do that at an event, send us an email to hello@langchain.dev with more information about yourself, what you want to talk about, and what city you're based in and we'll try to match you with an upcoming event!
- **Tell us about your LLM community:** If you host or participate in a community that would welcome support from LangChain and/or our team, send us an email at hello@langchain.dev and let us know how we can help.

# 📣 Help Us Amplify Your Work

If you're working on something you're proud of, and think the LangChain community would benefit from knowing about it, we want to help you show it off.

- **Post about your work and mention us:** we love hanging out on Twitter to see what people in the space are talking about and working on. If you tag [@langchainai](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI), we'll almost certainly see it and can show you some love.
- **Publish something on our blog:** if you're writing about your experience building with LangChain, we'd love to post (or crosspost) it on our blog! E-mail hello@langchain.dev with a draft of your post! Or even an idea for something you want to write about.
- **Get your product onto our [integrations hub](https://integrations.langchain.com/):** Many developers take advantage of our seamless integrations with other products, and come to our integrations hub to find out who those are. If you want to get your product up there, tell us about it (and how it works with LangChain) at hello@langchain.dev.

# ☀️ Stay in the loop

Here's where our team hangs out, talks shop, spotlights cool work, and shares what we're up to. We'd love to see you there too.

- **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI):** we post about what we're working on and what cool things we're seeing in the space. If you tag @langchainai in your post, we'll almost certainly see it, and can snow you some love!

# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](/docs/concepts/lcel), [components](/docs/concepts), and [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/).
 Use [LangGraph.js](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

 style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`@langchain/core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`@langchain/community`**: Third party integrations.
 - Partner packages (e.g. **`@langchain/openai`**, **`@langchain/anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`@langchain/core`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.

# 📕 Package Versioning

As of now, LangChain has an ad hoc release process: releases are cut with high frequency by
a maintainer and published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
The different packages are versioned slightly differently.

## `@langchain/core`

`@langchain/core` is currently on version `0.1.x`.

As `@langchain/core` contains the base abstractions and runtime for the whole LangChain ecosystem, we will communicate any breaking changes with advance notice and version bumps. The exception for this is anything marked with the `beta` decorator (you can see this in the API reference and will see warnings when using such functionality). The reason for beta features is that given the rate of change of the field, being able to move quickly is still a priority.

Minor version increases will occur for:

- Breaking changes for any public interfaces marked as `beta`.

Patch version increases will occur for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Any changes to private interfaces
- Any changes to `beta` features

## `langchain`

`langchain` is currently on version `0.1.x`

Minor version increases will occur for:

- Breaking changes for any public interfaces NOT marked as `beta`.

Patch version increases will occur for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Any changes to private interfaces
- Any changes to `beta` features

We are working on the `langchain` v0.2 release, which will have some breaking changes to legacy Chains and Agents.
Additionally, we will remove `@langchain/community` as a dependency and stop re-exporting integrations that have been moved to `@langchain/community`.

## `@langchain/community`

`@langchain/community` is currently on version `0.0.x`

All changes will be accompanied by a patch version increase.

## Partner Packages

Partner packages are versioned independently.

# Agents

By themselves, language models can't take actions - they just output text. Agents are systems that take a high-level task and use an LLM as a reasoning engine to decide what actions to take and execute those actions.

[LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) is an extension of LangChain specifically aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents. We recommend that you use LangGraph for building agents.

Please see the following resources for more information:

- LangGraph docs on [common agent architectures](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/agentic_concepts/)
- [Pre-built agents in LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph_prebuilt.createReactAgent.html)

## Legacy agent concept: AgentExecutor

LangChain previously introduced the `AgentExecutor` as a runtime for agents.
While it served as an excellent starting point, its limitations became apparent when dealing with more sophisticated and customized agents.
As a result, we're gradually phasing out `AgentExecutor` in favor of more flexible solutions in LangGraph.

### Transitioning from AgentExecutor to langgraph

If you're currently using `AgentExecutor`, don't worry! We've prepared resources to help you:

1. For those who still need to use `AgentExecutor`, we offer a comprehensive guide on [how to use AgentExecutor](/docs/how_to/agent_executor).

2. However, we strongly recommend transitioning to LangGraph for improved flexibility and control. To facilitate this transition, we've created a detailed [migration guide](/docs/how_to/migrate_agent) to help you move from `AgentExecutor` to LangGraph seamlessly.

/>

## @langchain/core

This package contains base abstractions for different components and ways to compose them together.
The interfaces for core components like chat models, vector stores, tools and more are defined here.
No third-party integrations are defined here.
The dependencies are very lightweight.

## langchain

The main `langchain` package contains chains and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
These are NOT third-party integrations.
All chains, agents, and retrieval strategies here are NOT specific to any one integration, but rather generic across all integrations.

## Integration packages

Popular integrations have their own packages (e.g. `@langchain/openai`, `@langchain/anthropic`, etc) so that they can be properly versioned and appropriately lightweight.

For more information see:

- A list [integrations packages](/docs/integrations/platforms/)
- The [API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/) where you can find detailed information about each of the integration package.

## @langchain/community

This package contains third-party integrations that are maintained by the LangChain community.
Key integration packages are separated out (see above).
This contains integrations for various components (chat models, vector stores, tools, etc).
All dependencies in this package are optional to keep the package as lightweight as possible.

## @langchain/langgraph

`@langchain/langgraph` is an orchestration framework aimed at building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

LangGraph exposes high level interfaces for creating common types of agents, as well as a low-level API for composing custom flows.

# Callbacks

:::note Prerequisites

- [Runnable interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)

:::

LangChain provides a callback system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.

You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail.

## Callback events

| Event | Event Trigger | Associated Method |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Chat model start | When a chat model starts | `handleChatModelStart` |
| LLM start | When a llm starts | `handleLlmStart` |
| LLM new token | When an llm OR chat model emits a new token | `handleLlmNewToken` |
| LLM ends | When an llm OR chat model ends | `handleLlmEnd` |
| LLM errors | When an llm OR chat model errors | `handleLlmError` |
| Chain start | When a chain starts running | `handleChainStart` |
| Chain end | When a chain ends | `handleChainEnd` |
| Chain error | When a chain errors | `handleChainError` |
| Tool start | When a tool starts running | `handleToolStart` |
| Tool end | When a tool ends | `handleToolEnd` |
| Tool error | When a tool errors | `handleToolError` |
| Retriever start | When a retriever starts | `handleRetrieverStart` |
| Retriever end | When a retriever ends | `handleRetrieverEnd` |
| Retriever error | When a retriever errors | `handleRetrieverError` |

## Callback handlers

- Callback handlers implement the [BaseCallbackHandler](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.callbacks_base.BaseCallbackHandler.html) interface.

During run-time LangChain configures an appropriate callback manager (e.g., [CallbackManager](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.callbacks_manager.BaseCallbackManager.html)) which will be responsible for calling the appropriate method on each "registered" callback handler when the event is triggered.

## Passing callbacks

The `callbacks` property is available on most objects throughout the API (Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:

- **Request time callbacks**: Passed at the time of the request in addition to the input data.
 Available on all standard `Runnable` objects. These callbacks are INHERITED by all children
 of the object they are defined on. For example, `await chain.invoke({ number: 25 }, { callbacks: [handler] })`.
- **Constructor callbacks**: `const chain = new TheNameOfSomeChain({ callbacks: [handler] })`. These callbacks
 are passed as arguments to the constructor of the object. The callbacks are scoped
 only to the object they are defined on, and are **not** inherited by any children of the object.

:::warning

Constructor callbacks are scoped only to the object they are defined on. They are **not** inherited by children
of the object.

:::

If you're creating a custom chain or runnable, you need to remember to propagate request time
callbacks to any child objects.

For specifics on how to use callbacks, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#callbacks).

# Chat history

:::info Prerequisites

- [Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)

:::

Chat history is a record of the conversation between the user and the chat model. It is used to maintain context and state throughout the conversation. The chat history is sequence of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages), each of which is associated with a specific [role](/docs/concepts/messages#role), such as "user", "assistant", "system", or "tool".

## Conversation patterns

![Conversation patterns](/img/conversation_patterns.png)

Most conversations start with a **system message** that sets the context for the conversation. This is followed by a **user message** containing the user's input, and then an **assistant message** containing the model's response.

The **assistant** may respond directly to the user or if configured with tools request that a [tool](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) be invoked to perform a specific task.

So a full conversation often involves a combination of two patterns of alternating messages:

1. The **user** and the **assistant** representing a back-and-forth conversation.
2. The **assistant** and **tool messages** representing an ["agentic" workflow](/docs/concepts/agents) where the assistant is invoking tools to perform specific tasks.

## Managing chat history

Since chat models have a maximum limit on input size, it's important to manage chat history and trim it as needed to avoid exceeding the [context window](/docs/concepts/chat_models#context_window).

While processing chat history, it's essential to preserve a correct conversation structure.

Key guidelines for managing chat history:

- The conversation should follow one of these structures:
 - The first message is either a "user" message or a "system" message, followed by a "user" and then an "assistant" message.
 - The last message should be either a "user" message or a "tool" message containing the result of a tool call.
- When using [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling), a "tool" message should only follow an "assistant" message that requested the tool invocation.

:::tip

Understanding correct conversation structure is essential for being able to properly implement
[memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/) in chat models.

# Chat models

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models that excel in a wide range of language-related tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and more, without needing task-specific tuning for every scenario.

Modern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes a list of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as input and returns a [message](/docs/concepts/messages) as output.

The newest generation of chat models offer additional capabilities:

- [Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling): Many popular chat models offer a native [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) API. This API allows developers to build rich applications that enable AI to interact with external services, APIs, and databases. Tool calling can also be used to extract structured information from unstructured data and perform various other tasks.
- [Structured output](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs): A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.
- [Multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality): The ability to work with data other than text; for example, images, audio, and video.

## Features

LangChain provides a consistent interface for working with chat models from different providers while offering additional features for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing the performance of applications that use LLMs.

- Integrations with many chat model providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Microsoft Azure, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Hugging Face, Cohere, Groq). Please see [chat model integrations](/docs/integrations/chat/) for an up-to-date list of supported models.
- Use either LangChain's [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) format or OpenAI format.
- Standard [tool calling API](/docs/concepts/tool_calling): standard interface for binding tools to models, accessing tool call requests made by models, and sending tool results back to the model.
- Standard API for structuring outputs (/docs/concepts/structured_outputs) via the `withStructuredOutput` method.
- Integration with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com) for monitoring and debugging production-grade applications based on LLMs.
- Additional features like standardized [token usage](/docs/concepts/messages#token_usage), [rate limiting](#rate-limiting), [caching](#cache) and more.

## Integrations

LangChain has many chat model integrations that allow you to use a wide variety of models from different providers.

These integrations are one of two types:

1. **Official models**: These are models that are officially supported by LangChain and/or model provider. You can find these models in the `@langchain/<provider>` packages.
2. **Community models**: There are models that are mostly contributed and supported by the community. You can find these models in the `@langchain/community` package.

LangChain chat models are named with a convention that prefixes "Chat" to their class names (e.g., `ChatOllama`, `ChatAnthropic`, `ChatOpenAI`, etc.).

Please review the [chat model integrations](/docs/integrations/chat/) for a list of supported models.

:::note
Models that do **not** include the prefix "Chat" in their name or include "LLM" as a suffix in their name typically refer to older models that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output.
:::

## Interface

LangChain chat models implement the [BaseChatModel](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html) interface. Because BaseChatModel also implements the [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables), chat models support a [standard streaming interface](/docs/concepts/streaming), optimized [batching](/docs/concepts/runnables#batch), and more. Please see the [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables) for more details.

Many of the key methods of chat models operate on [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as input and return messages as output.

Chat models offer a standard set of parameters that can be used to configure the model. These parameters are typically used to control the behavior of the model, such as the temperature of the output, the maximum number of tokens in the response, and the maximum time to wait for a response. Please see the [standard parameters](#standard-parameters) section for more details.

:::note
In documentation, we will often use the terms "LLM" and "Chat Model" interchangeably. This is because most modern LLMs are exposed to users via a chat model interface.

However, LangChain also has implementations of older LLMs that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output. These models are typically named without the "Chat" prefix (e.g., `Ollama`, `Anthropic`, `OpenAI`, etc.).
These models implement the [BaseLLM](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_llms.BaseLLM.html) interface and may be named with the "LLM" suffix (e.g., `OpenAILLM`, etc.). Generally, users should not use these models.
:::

### Key methods

The key methods of a chat model are:

1. **invoke**: The primary method for interacting with a chat model. It takes a list of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as input and returns a list of messages as output.
2. **stream**: A method that allows you to stream the output of a chat model as it is generated.
3. **batch**: A method that allows you to batch multiple requests to a chat model together for more efficient processing.
4. **bindTools**: A method that allows you to bind a tool to a chat model for use in the model's execution context.
5. **withStructuredOutput**: A wrapper around the `invoke` method for models that natively support [structured output](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs).

Other important methods can be found in the [BaseChatModel API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html).

### Inputs and outputs

Modern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as input and returns [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as output. Messages are typically associated with a role (e.g., "system", "human", "assistant") and one or more content blocks that contain text or potentially multimodal data (e.g., images, audio, video).

LangChain supports two message formats to interact with chat models:

1. **LangChain Message Format**: LangChain's own message format, which is used by default and is used internally by LangChain.
2. **OpenAI's Message Format**: OpenAI's message format.

### Standard parameters

Many chat models have standardized parameters that can be used to configure the model:

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model` | The name or identifier of the specific AI model you want to use (e.g., `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` or `"gpt-4"`). |
| `temperature` | Controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher value (e.g., 1.0) makes responses more creative, while a lower value (e.g., 0.1) makes them more deterministic and focused. |
| `timeout` | The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request. Ensures the request doesn’t hang indefinitely. |
| `maxTokens` | Limits the total number of tokens (words and punctuation) in the response. This controls how long the output can be. |
| `stop` | Specifies stop sequences that indicate when the model should stop generating tokens. For example, you might use specific strings to signal the end of a response. |
| `maxRetries` | The maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits. |
| `apiKey` | The API key required for authenticating with the model provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. |
| `baseUrl` | The URL of the API endpoint where requests are sent. This is typically provided by the model's provider and is necessary for directing your requests. |

Some important things to note:

- Standard parameters only apply to model providers that expose parameters with the intended functionality. For example, some providers do not expose a configuration for maximum output tokens, so max_tokens can't be supported on these.
- Standard params are currently only enforced on integrations that have their own integration packages (e.g. `@langchain/openai`, `@langchain/anthropic`, etc.), they're not enforced on models in `@langchain/community`.

ChatModels also accept other parameters that are specific to that integration. To find all the parameters supported by a ChatModel head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/) for that model.

## Tool calling

Chat models can call [tools](/docs/concepts/tools) to perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, making API requests, or running custom code. Please
see the [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) guide for more information.

## Structured outputs

Chat models can be requested to respond in a particular format (e.g., JSON or matching a particular schema). This feature is extremely
useful for information extraction tasks. Please read more about
the technique in the [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs) guide.

## Multimodality

Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to processing text. They can also be used to process other types of data, such as images, audio, and video. This is known as [multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality).

Currently, only some LLMs support multimodal inputs, and almost none support multimodal outputs. Please consult the specific model documentation for details.

## Context window

A chat model's context window refers to the maximum size of the input sequence the model can process at one time. While the context windows of modern LLMs are quite large, they still present a limitation that developers must keep in mind when working with chat models.

If the input exceeds the context window, the model may not be able to process the entire input and could raise an error. In conversational applications, this is especially important because the context window determines how much information the model can "remember" throughout a conversation. Developers often need to manage the input within the context window to maintain a coherent dialogue without exceeding the limit. For more details on handling memory in conversations, refer to the [memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/).

The size of the input is measured in [tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens) which are the unit of processing that the model uses.

## Advanced topics

### Caching

Chat model APIs can be slow, so a natural question is whether to cache the results of previous conversations. Theoretically, caching can help improve performance by reducing the number of requests made to the model provider. In practice, caching chat model responses is a complex problem and should be approached with caution.

The reason is that getting a cache hit is unlikely after the first or second interaction in a conversation if relying on caching the **exact** inputs into the model. For example, how likely do you think that multiple conversations start with the exact same message? What about the exact same three messages?

An alternative approach is to use semantic caching, where you cache responses based on the meaning of the input rather than the exact input itself. This can be effective in some situations, but not in others.

A semantic cache introduces a dependency on another model on the critical path of your application (e.g., the semantic cache may rely on an [embedding model](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) to convert text to a vector representation), and it's not guaranteed to capture the meaning of the input accurately.

However, there might be situations where caching chat model responses is beneficial. For example, if you have a chat model that is used to answer frequently asked questions, caching responses can help reduce the load on the model provider and improve response times.

Please see the [how to cache chat model responses](/docs/how_to/#chat-model-caching) guide for more details.

# Document loaders

<span data-heading-keywords="document loader,document loaders"></span>

:::info[Prerequisites]

- [Document loaders API reference](/docs/how_to/#document-loaders)

:::

Document loaders are designed to load document objects. LangChain has hundreds of integrations with various data sources to load data from: Slack, Notion, Google Drive, etc.

## Integrations

You can find available integrations on the [Document loaders integrations page](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/).

## Interface

Documents loaders implement the [BaseLoader interface](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.document_loaders_base.BaseDocumentLoader.html).

Each DocumentLoader has its own specific parameters, but they can all be invoked in the same way with the `.load` method or `.lazy_load`.

Here's a simple example:

```typescript
import { CSVLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/csv";

const loader = new CSVLoader(
 ... // <-- Integration specific parameters here
);
const data = await loader.load();
```

# Embedding models

<span data-heading-keywords="embedding,embeddings"></span>

:::info[Prerequisites]

- [Documents](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html)

:::

:::info[Note]

This conceptual overview focuses on text-based embedding models.

Embedding models can also be [multimodal](/docs/concepts/multimodality) though such models are not currently supported by LangChain.

:::

Imagine being able to capture the essence of any text - a tweet, document, or book - in a single, compact representation.
This is the power of embedding models, which lie at the heart of many retrieval systems.
Embedding models transform human language into a format that machines can understand and compare with speed and accuracy.
These models take text as input and produce a fixed-length array of numbers, a numerical fingerprint of the text's semantic meaning.
Embeddings allow search system to find relevant documents not just based on keyword matches, but on semantic understanding.

## Key concepts

![Conceptual Overview](/img/embeddings_concept.png)

(1) **Embed text as a vector**: Embeddings transform text into a numerical vector representation.

(2) **Measure similarity**: Embedding vectors can be comparing using simple mathematical operations.

## Embedding

### Historical context

The landscape of embedding models has evolved significantly over the years.
A pivotal moment came in 2018 when Google introduced [BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/bert/).
BERT applied transformer models to embed text as a simple vector representation, which lead to unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks.
However, BERT wasn't optimized for generating sentence embeddings efficiently.
This limitation spurred the creation of [SBERT (Sentence-BERT)](https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/sts/README.html), which adapted the BERT architecture to generate semantically rich sentence embeddings, easily comparable via similarity metrics like cosine similarity, dramatically reduced the computational overhead for tasks like finding similar sentences.
Today, the embedding model ecosystem is diverse, with numerous providers offering their own implementations.
To navigate this variety, researchers and practitioners often turn to benchmarks like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb) for objective comparisons.

:::info[Further reading]

- See the [seminal BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).
- See Cameron Wolfe's [excellent review](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-ai-powered-vector-search?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) of embedding models.
- See the [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb) leaderboard for a comprehensive overview of embedding models.

:::

### Interface

LangChain provides a universal interface for working with them, providing standard methods for common operations.
This common interface simplifies interaction with various embedding providers through two central methods:

- `embedDocuments`: For embedding multiple texts (documents)
- `embedQuery`: For embedding a single text (query)

This distinction is important, as some providers employ different embedding strategies for documents (which are to be searched) versus queries (the search input itself).
To illustrate, here's a practical example using LangChain's `.embedDocuments` method to embed a list of strings:

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
const embeddingsModel = new OpenAIEmbeddings();
const embeddings = await embeddingsModel.embedDocuments([
 "Hi there!",
 "Oh, hello!",
 "What's your name?",
 "My friends call me World",
 "Hello World!",
]);

console.log(`(${embeddings.length}, ${embeddings[0].length})`);
// (5, 1536)
```

For convenience, you can also use the `embedQuery` method to embed a single text:

```typescript
const queryEmbedding = await embeddingsModel.embedQuery(
 "What is the meaning of life?"
);
```

- See these [how-to guides](/docs/how_to/embed_text) for working with embedding models.

:::

### Integrations

LangChain offers many embedding model integrations which you can find [on the embedding models](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/) integrations page.

## Measure similarity

Each embedding is essentially a set of coordinates, often in a high-dimensional space.
In this space, the position of each point (embedding) reflects the meaning of its corresponding text.
Just as similar words might be close to each other in a thesaurus, similar concepts end up close to each other in this embedding space.
This allows for intuitive comparisons between different pieces of text.
By reducing text to these numerical representations, we can use simple mathematical operations to quickly measure how alike two pieces of text are, regardless of their original length or structure.
Some common similarity metrics include:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points.
- **Dot Product**: Measures the projection of one vector onto another.

The choice of similarity metric should be chosen based on the model.
As an example, [OpenAI suggests cosine similarity for their embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use), which can be easily implemented:

```typescript
function cosineSimilarity(vec1: number[], vec2: number[]): number {
 const dotProduct = vec1.reduce((sum, val, i) => sum + val * vec2[i], 0);
 const norm1 = Math.sqrt(vec1.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val * val, 0));
 const norm2 = Math.sqrt(vec2.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val * val, 0));
 return dotProduct / (norm1 * norm2);
}

const similarity = cosineSimilarity(queryResult, documentResult);
console.log("Cosine Similarity:", similarity);
```

# Evaluation

<span data-heading-keywords="evaluation,evaluate"></span>

Evaluation is the process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of your LLM-powered applications.
It involves testing the model's responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose.
This process is vital for building reliable applications.

![](/img/langsmith_evaluate.png)

[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) helps with this process in a few ways:

- It makes it easier to create and curate datasets via its tracing and annotation features
- It provides an evaluation framework that helps you define metrics and run your app against your dataset
- It allows you to track results over time and automatically run your evaluators on a schedule or as part of CI/Code

- [Few-shot prompting](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/)

:::

## Overview

One common prompting technique for achieving better performance is to include examples as part of the prompt. This is known as [few-shot prompting](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting).

This gives the [language model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) concrete examples of how it should behave.
Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for more advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them.

**Example Selectors** are classes responsible for selecting and then formatting examples into prompts.

# Few-shot prompting

:::note Prerequisites

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/)

:::

## Overview

One of the most effective ways to improve model performance is to give a model examples of
what you want it to do. The technique of adding example inputs and expected outputs
to a model prompt is known as "few-shot prompting". The technique is based on the
[Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) paper.
There are a few things to think about when doing few-shot prompting:

1. How are examples generated?
2. How many examples are in each prompt?
3. How are examples selected at runtime?
4. How are examples formatted in the prompt?

Here are the considerations for each.

## 1. Generating examples

The first and most important step of few-shot prompting is coming up with a good dataset of examples. Good examples should be relevant at runtime, clear, informative, and provide information that was not already known to the model.

At a high-level, the basic ways to generate examples are:

- Manual: a person/people generates examples they think are useful.
- Better model: a better (presumably more expensive/slower) model's responses are used as examples for a worse (presumably cheaper/faster) model.
- User feedback: users (or labelers) leave feedback on interactions with the application and examples are generated based on that feedback (for example, all interactions with positive feedback could be turned into examples).
- LLM feedback: same as user feedback but the process is automated by having models evaluate themselves.

Which approach is best depends on your task. For tasks where a small number core principles need to be understood really well, it can be valuable hand-craft a few really good examples.
For tasks where the space of correct behaviors is broader and more nuanced, it can be useful to generate many examples in a more automated fashion so that there's a higher likelihood of there being some highly relevant examples for any runtime input.

**Single-turn v.s. multi-turn examples**

Another dimension to think about when generating examples is what the example is actually showing.

The simplest types of examples just have a user input and an expected model output. These are single-turn examples.

One more complex type if example is where the example is an entire conversation, usually in which a model initially responds incorrectly and a user then tells the model how to correct its answer.
This is called a multi-turn example. Multi-turn examples can be useful for more nuanced tasks where its useful to show common errors and spell out exactly why they're wrong and what should be done instead.

## 2. Number of examples

Once we have a dataset of examples, we need to think about how many examples should be in each prompt.
The key tradeoff is that more examples generally improve performance, but larger prompts increase costs and latency.
And beyond some threshold having too many examples can start to confuse the model.
Finding the right number of examples is highly dependent on the model, the task, the quality of the examples, and your cost and latency constraints.
Anecdotally, the better the model is the fewer examples it needs to perform well and the more quickly you hit steeply diminishing returns on adding more examples.
But, the best/only way to reliably answer this question is to run some experiments with different numbers of examples.

## 3. Selecting examples

Assuming we are not adding our entire example dataset into each prompt, we need to have a way of selecting examples from our dataset based on a given input. We can do this:

- Randomly
- By (semantic or keyword-based) similarity of the inputs
- Based on some other constraints, like token size

LangChain has a number of [`ExampleSelectors`](/docs/concepts/example_selectors) which make it easy to use any of these techniques.

Generally, selecting by semantic similarity leads to the best model performance. But how important this is is again model and task specific, and is something worth experimenting with.

## 4. Formatting examples

Most state-of-the-art models these days are chat models, so we'll focus on formatting examples for those. Our basic options are to insert the examples:

- In the system prompt as a string
- As their own messages

If we insert our examples into the system prompt as a string, we'll need to make sure it's clear to the model where each example begins and which parts are the input versus output. Different models respond better to different syntaxes, like [ChatML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chat-markup-language), XML, TypeScript, etc.

If we insert our examples as messages, where each example is represented as a sequence of Human, AI messages, we might want to also assign [names](/docs/concepts/messages) to our messages like `"example_user"` and `"example_assistant"` to make it clear that these messages correspond to different actors than the latest input message.

**Formatting tool call examples**

One area where formatting examples as messages can be tricky is when our example outputs have tool calls. This is because different models have different constraints on what types of message sequences are allowed when any tool calls are generated.

- Some models require that any `AIMessage` with tool calls be immediately followed by `ToolMessage`s for every tool call,
- Some models additionally require that any `ToolMessage`s be immediately followed by an `AIMessage` before the next `HumanMessage`,
- Some models require that tools are passed in to the model if there are any tool calls / `ToolMessage`s in the chat history.

These requirements are model-specific and should be checked for the model you are using. If your model requires `ToolMessage`s after tool calls and/or `AIMessage`s after `ToolMessage`s and your examples only include expected tool calls and not the actual tool outputs, you can try adding dummy `ToolMessage`s / `AIMessage`s to the end of each example with generic contents to satisfy the API constraints.
In these cases it's especially worth experimenting with inserting your examples as strings versus messages, as having dummy messages can adversely affect certain models.

You can see a case study of how Anthropic and OpenAI respond to different few-shot prompting techniques on two different tool calling benchmarks [here](https://blog.langchain.dev/few-shot-prompting-to-improve-tool-calling-performance/).

# Key-value stores

## Overview

LangChain provides a key-value store interface for storing and retrieving data.

LangChain includes a [`BaseStore`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.stores.BaseStore.html) interface,
which allows for storage of arbitrary data. However, LangChain components that require KV-storage accept a
more specific `BaseStore<string, Uint8Array>` instance that stores binary data (referred to as a `ByteStore`), and internally take care of
encoding and decoding data for their specific needs.

This means that as a user, you only need to think about one type of store rather than different ones for different types of data.

## Usage

The key-value store interface in LangChain is used primarily for:

1. Caching [embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) via [CachedBackedEmbeddings](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.embeddings_cache_backed.CacheBackedEmbeddings.html) to avoid recomputing embeddings for repeated queries or when re-indexing content.

2. As a simple [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) persistence layer in some retrievers.

Please see these how-to guides for more information:

- [How to cache embeddings guide](/docs/how_to/caching_embeddings/).
- [How to retriever using multiple vectors per document](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

## Interface

All [`BaseStore`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.stores.BaseStore.html)s support the following interface. Note that the interface allows for modifying **multiple** key-value pairs at once:

- `mget(keys: string[]): Promise<(Uint8Array | undefined)[]>`: get the contents of multiple keys, returning `undefined` if the key does not exist
- `mset(keyValuePairs: [string, Uint8Array][]): Promise<void>`: set the contents of multiple keys
- `mdelete(keys: string[]): Promise<void>`: delete multiple keys
- `yieldKeys(prefix?: string): AsyncIterator<string>`: yield all keys in the store, optionally filtering by a prefix

## Integrations

Please reference the [stores integration page](/docs/integrations/stores/) for a list of available key-value store integrations.

# LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

:::info Prerequisites

- [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)

:::

The **L**ang**C**hain **E**xpression **L**anguage (LCEL) takes a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) approach to building new [Runnables](/docs/concepts/runnables) from existing Runnables.

This means that you describe what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.

We often refer to a `Runnable` created using LCEL as a "chain". It's important to remember that a "chain" is `Runnable` and it implements the full [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables).

:::note

- The [LCEL cheatsheet](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/) shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.
- Please see the following list of [how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) that cover common tasks with LCEL.
- A list of built-in `Runnables` can be found in the [LangChain Core API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/_langchain_core.runnables.html). Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom "chains" in LangChain using LCEL.

:::

## Benefits of LCEL

LangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:

- **Optimize parallel execution**: Run Runnables in parallel using [RunnableParallel](#RunnableParallel) or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the [Runnable Batch API](/docs/concepts/runnables#batch). Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.
- **Simplify streaming**: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) or [llm](/docs/concepts/text_llms) comes out).

Other benefits include:

- [**Seamless LangSmith tracing**](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)
 As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.
 With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) for maximum observability and debuggability.
- **Standard API**: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.
- [**Deployable with LangServe**](/docs/concepts/architecture#langserve): Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.

## Should I use LCEL?

LCEL is an [orchestration solution](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)>) -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.

While we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph).

In LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the flow of the application. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.

Here are some guidelines:

- If you are making a single LLM call, you don't need LCEL; instead call the underlying [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) directly.
- If you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you're taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.
- If you're building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.

## Composition Primitives

`LCEL` chains are built by composing existing `Runnables` together. The two main composition primitives are [RunnableSequence](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableSequence.html) and [RunnableParallel](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableParallel.html).

Many other composition primitives (e.g., [RunnableAssign](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableAssign.html)) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.

:::note
You can find a list of all composition primitives in the [LangChain Core API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/_langchain_core.runnables.html).
:::

### RunnableSequence

`RunnableSequence` is a composition primitive that allows you "chain" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.

```typescript
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
const chain = new RunnableSequence({
 first: runnable1,
 // Optional, use if you have more than two runnables
 // middle: [...],
 last: runnable2,
});
```

Invoking the `chain` with some input:

```typescript
const finalOutput = await chain.invoke(someInput);
```

corresponds to the following:

```typescript
const output1 = await runnable1.invoke(someInput);
const finalOutput = await runnable2.invoke(output1);
```

:::note
`runnable1` and `runnable2` are placeholders for any `Runnable` that you want to chain together.
:::

### RunnableParallel

`RunnableParallel` is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.

```typescript
import { RunnableParallel } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
const chain = new RunnableParallel({
 key1: runnable1,
 key2: runnable2,
});
```

Invoking the `chain` with some input:

```typescript
const finalOutput = await chain.invoke(someInput);
```

Will yield a `finalOutput` object with the same keys as the input object, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.

```typescript
{
 key1: await runnable1.invoke(someInput),
 key2: await runnable2.invoke(someInput),
}
```

Recall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as
object comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.

## Composition Syntax

The usage of `RunnableSequence` and `RunnableParallel` is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps
to make the code more readable and concise.

### The `pipe` method.

You can `pipe` runnables together using the `.pipe(runnable)` method.

```typescript
const chain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2);
```

is Equivalent to:

```typescript
const chain = new RunnableSequence({
 first: runnable1,
 last: runnable2,
});
```

#### RunnableLambda functions

You can define generic TypeScript functions are runnables through the `RunnableLambda` class.

```typescript
const someFunc = RunnableLambda.from((input) => {
 return input;
});

const chain = someFunc.pipe(runnable1);
```

## Legacy chains

LCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as `LLMChain` and
`ConversationalRetrievalChain`. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety
of viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.

# Messages

:::info Prerequisites

- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

:::

## Overview

Messages are the unit of communication in [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models). They are used to represent the input and output of a chat model, as well as any additional context or metadata that may be associated with a conversation.

Each message has a **role** (e.g., "user", "assistant"), **content** (e.g., text, multimodal data), and additional metadata that can vary depending on the chat model provider.

LangChain provides a unified message format that can be used across chat models, allowing users to work with different chat models without worrying about the specific details of the message format used by each model provider.

## What inside a message?

A message typically consists of the following pieces of information:

- **Role**: The role of the message (e.g., "user", "assistant").
- **Content**: The content of the message (e.g., text, multimodal data).
- Additional metadata: id, name, [token usage](/docs/concepts/tokens) and other model-specific metadata.

### Role

Roles are used to distinguish between different types of messages in a conversation and help the chat model understand how to respond to a given sequence of messages.

| **Role** | **Description** |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **system** | Used to tell the chat model how to behave and provide additional context. Not supported by all chat model providers. |
| **user** | Represents input from a user interacting with the model, usually in the form of text or other interactive input. |
| **assistant** | Represents a response from the model, which can include text or a request to invoke tools. |
| **tool** | A message used to pass the results of a tool invocation back to the model after external data or processing has been retrieved. Used with chat models that support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling). |
| **function** (legacy) | This is a legacy role, corresponding to OpenAI's legacy function-calling API. **tool** role should be used instead. |

### Content

The content of a message text or an array of objects representing [multimodal data](/docs/concepts/multimodality) (e.g., images, audio, video). The exact format of the content can vary between different chat model providers.

Currently, most chat models support text as the primary content type, with some models also supporting multimodal data. However, support for multimodal data is still limited across most chat model providers.

For more information see:

- [HumanMessage](#humanmessage) -- for content in the input from the user.
- [AIMessage](#aimessage) -- for content in the response from the model.
- [Multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality) -- for more information on multimodal content.

### Other Message Data

Depending on the chat model provider, messages can include other data such as:

- **ID**: An optional unique identifier for the message.
- **Name**: An optional `name` property which allows differentiate between different entities/speakers with the same role. Not all models support this!
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the message, such as timestamps, token usage, etc.
- **Tool Calls**: A request made by the model to call one or more tools> See [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) for more information.

## Conversation Structure

The sequence of messages into a chat model should follow a specific structure to ensure that the chat model can generate a valid response.

For example, a typical conversation structure might look like this:

1. **User Message**: "Hello, how are you?"
2. **Assistant Message**: "I'm doing well, thank you for asking."
3. **User Message**: "Can you tell me a joke?"
4. **Assistant Message**: "Sure! Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!"

Please read the [chat history](/docs/concepts/chat_history) guide for more information on managing chat history and ensuring that the conversation structure is correct.

## LangChain Messages

LangChain provides a unified message format that can be used across all chat models, allowing users to work with different chat models without worrying about the specific details of the message format used by each model provider.

LangChain messages are classes that subclass from a [BaseMessage](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.messages.BaseMessage.html).

The five main message types are:

- [SystemMessage](#systemmessage): corresponds to **system** role
- [HumanMessage](#humanmessage): corresponds to **user** role
- [AIMessage](#aimessage): corresponds to **assistant** role
- [AIMessageChunk](#aimessagechunk): corresponds to **assistant** role, used for [streaming](/docs/concepts/streaming) responses
- [ToolMessage](#toolmessage): corresponds to **tool** role

Other important messages include:

- [RemoveMessage](#removemessage) -- does not correspond to any role. This is an abstraction, mostly used in [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) to manage chat history.
- **Legacy** [FunctionMessage](#legacy-functionmessage): corresponds to the **function** role in OpenAI's **legacy** function-calling API.

You can find more information about **messages** in the [API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/_langchain_core.messages.html).

### SystemMessage

A `SystemMessage` is used to prime the behavior of the AI model and provide additional context, such as instructing the model to adopt a specific persona or setting the tone of the conversation (e.g., "This is a conversation about cooking").

Different chat providers may support system message in one of the following ways:

- **Through a "system" message role**: In this case, a system message is included as part of the message sequence with the role explicitly set as "system."
- **Through a separate API parameter for system instructions**: Instead of being included as a message, system instructions are passed via a dedicated API parameter.
- **No support for system messages**: Some models do not support system messages at all.

Most major chat model providers support system instructions via either a chat message or a separate API parameter. LangChain will automatically adapt based on the provider’s capabilities. If the provider supports a separate API parameter for system instructions, LangChain will extract the content of a system message and pass it through that parameter.

If no system message is supported by the provider, in most cases LangChain will attempt to incorporate the system message's content into a HumanMessage or raise an exception if that is not possible. However, this behavior is not yet consistently enforced across all implementations, and if using a less popular implementation of a chat model (e.g., an implementation from the `@langchain/community` package) it is recommended to check the specific documentation for that model.

### HumanMessage

The `HumanMessage` corresponds to the **"user"** role. A human message represents input from a user interacting with the model.

#### Text Content

Most chat models expect the user input to be in the form of text.

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await model.invoke([new HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")]);
```

:::tip
When invoking a chat model with a string as input, LangChain will automatically convert the string into a `HumanMessage` object. This is mostly useful for quick testing.

```typescript
await model.invoke("Hello, how are you?");
```

:::

#### Multi-modal Content

Some chat models accept multimodal inputs, such as images, audio, video, or files like PDFs.

Please see the [multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality) guide for more information.

### AIMessage

`AIMessage` is used to represent a message with the role **"assistant"**. This is the response from the model, which can include text or a request to invoke tools. It could also include other media types like images, audio, or video -- though this is still uncommon at the moment.

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const aiMessage = await model.invoke([new HumanMessage("Tell me a joke")]);
console.log(aiMessage);
```

```text
AIMessage({
 content: "Why did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side!",
 tool_calls: [],
 response_metadata: { ... },
 usage_metadata: { ... },
})
```

An `AIMessage` has the following attributes. The attributes which are **standardized** are the ones that LangChain attempts to standardize across different chat model providers. **raw** fields are specific to the model provider and may vary.

| Attribute | Standardized/Raw | Description |
| -------------------- | :--------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `content` | Raw | Usually a string, but can be a list of content blocks. See [content](#content) for details. |
| `tool_calls` | Standardized | Tool calls associated with the message. See [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) for details. |
| `invalid_tool_calls` | Standardized | Tool calls with parsing errors associated with the message. See [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) for details. |
| `usage_metadata` | Standardized | Usage metadata for a message, such as [token counts](/docs/concepts/tokens). See [Usage Metadata API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages.UsageMetadata.html). |
| `id` | Standardized | An optional unique identifier for the message, ideally provided by the provider/model that created the message. |
| `response_metadata` | Raw | Response metadata, e.g., response headers, logprobs, token counts. |

#### content

The **content** property of an `AIMessage` represents the response generated by the chat model.

The content is either:

- **text** -- the norm for virtually all chat models.
- A **array of objects** -- Each object represents a content block and is associated with a `type`.
 - Used by Anthropic for surfacing agent thought process when doing [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).
 - Used by OpenAI for audio outputs. Please see [multi-modal content](/docs/concepts/multimodality) for more information.

:::important
The **content** property is **not** standardized across different chat model providers, mostly because there are
still few examples to generalize from.
:::

### AIMessageChunk

It is common to [stream](/docs/concepts/streaming) responses for the chat model as they are being generated, so the user can see the response in real-time instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated before displaying it.

It is returned from the `stream`, and `streamEvents` methods of the chat model.

For example,

```typescript
for await (const chunk of model.stream([
 new HumanMessage("what color is the sky?"),
])) {
 console.log(chunk);
}
```

`AIMessageChunk` follows nearly the same structure as `AIMessage`, but uses a different [ToolCallChunk](https://api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages_tool.ToolCallChunk.html)
to be able to stream tool calling in a standardized manner.

#### Aggregating

`<Type>MessageChunks` have a `concat` method you can use, or you can import it. This is useful when you want to display the final response to the user.

```typescript
const aiMessage = chunk1.concat(chunk2).concat(chunk3).concat(...);
```

or

```typescript
import { concat } from "@langchain/core/utils/stream";
const aiMessage = concat(chunk1, chunk2);
```

### ToolMessage

This represents a message with role "tool", which contains the result of [calling a tool](/docs/concepts/tool_calling). In addition to `role` and `content`, this message has:

- a `tool_call_id` field which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.
- an `artifact` field which can be used to pass along arbitrary artifacts of the tool execution which are useful to track but which should not be sent to the model.

Please see [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) for more information.

### RemoveMessage

This is a special message type that does not correspond to any roles. It is used
for managing chat history in [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph).

Please see the following for more information on how to use the `RemoveMessage`:

- [Memory conceptual guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/)
- [How to delete messages](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/delete-messages/)

### (Legacy) FunctionMessage

This is a legacy message type, corresponding to OpenAI's legacy function-calling API. `ToolMessage` should be used instead to correspond to the updated tool-calling API.

## OpenAI Format

### Inputs

Chat models also accept OpenAI's format as **inputs** to chat models:

```typescript
await chatModel.invoke([
 {
 role: "user",
 content: "Hello, how are you?",
 },
 {
 role: "assistant",
 content: "I'm doing well, thank you for asking.",
 },
 {
 role: "user",
 content: "Can you tell me a joke?",
 },
]);
```

### Outputs

At the moment, the output of the model will be in terms of LangChain messages, so you will need to convert the output to the OpenAI format if you
need OpenAI format for the output as well.

# Multimodality

## Overview

**Multimodality** refers to the ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video. Multimodality can appear in various components, allowing models and systems to handle and process a mix of these data types seamlessly.

- **Chat Models**: These could, in theory, accept and generate multimodal inputs and outputs, handling a variety of data types like text, images, audio, and video.
- **Embedding Models**: Embedding Models can represent multimodal content, embedding various forms of data—such as text, images, and audio—into vector spaces.
- **Vector Stores**: Vector stores could search over embeddings that represent multimodal data, enabling retrieval across different types of information.

## Multimodality in chat models

:::info Pre-requisites

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)

:::

Multimodal support is still relatively new and less common, model providers have not yet standardized on the "best" way to define the API. As such, LangChain's multimodal abstractions are lightweight and flexible, designed to accommodate different model providers' APIs and interaction patterns, but are **not** standardized across models.

### How to use multimodal models

- Use the [chat model integration table](/docs/integrations/chat/) to identify which models support multimodality.
- Reference the [relevant how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#multimodal) for specific examples of how to use multimodal models.

### What kind of multimodality is supported?

#### Inputs

Some models can accept multimodal inputs, such as images, audio, video, or files. The types of multimodal inputs supported depend on the model provider. For instance, [Google's Gemini](/docs/integrations/chat/google_generativeai/) supports documents like PDFs as inputs.

Most chat models that support **multimodal inputs** also accept those values in OpenAI's content blocks format. So far this is restricted to image inputs. For models like Gemini which support video and other bytes input, the APIs also support the native, model-specific representations.

The gist of passing multimodal inputs to a chat model is to use content blocks that specify a type and corresponding data. For example, to pass an image to a chat model:

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const message = new HumanMessage({
 content: [
 { type: "text", text: "describe the weather in this image" },
 { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: image_url } },
 ],
});
const response = await model.invoke([message]);
```

:::caution
The exact format of the content blocks may vary depending on the model provider. Please refer to the chat model's
integration documentation for the correct format. Find the integration in the [chat model integration table](/docs/integrations/chat/).
:::

#### Outputs

Virtually no popular chat models support multimodal outputs at the time of writing (October 2024).

The only exception is OpenAI's chat model ([gpt-4o-audio-preview](/docs/integrations/chat/openai/)), which can generate audio outputs.

Multimodal outputs will appear as part of the [AIMessage](/docs/concepts/messages/#aimessage) response object.

Please see the [ChatOpenAI](/docs/integrations/chat/openai/) for more information on how to use multimodal outputs.

#### Tools

Currently, no chat model is designed to work **directly** with multimodal data in a [tool call request](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) or [ToolMessage](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) result.

However, a chat model can easily interact with multimodal data by invoking tools with references (e.g., a URL) to the multimodal data, rather than the data itself. For example, any model capable of [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) can be equipped with tools to download and process images, audio, or video.

## Multimodality in embedding models

:::info Prerequisites

- [Embedding Models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)

:::

**Embeddings** are vector representations of data used for tasks like similarity search and retrieval.

The current [embedding interface](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.embeddings.Embeddings.html) used in LangChain is optimized entirely for text-based data, and will **not** work with multimodal data.

As use cases involving multimodal search and retrieval tasks become more common, we expect to expand the embedding interface to accommodate other data types like images, audio, and video.

## Multimodality in vector stores

:::info Prerequisites

- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)

:::

Vector stores are databases for storing and retrieving embeddings, which are typically used in search and retrieval tasks. Similar to embeddings, vector stores are currently optimized for text-based data.

As use cases involving multimodal search and retrieval tasks become more common, we expect to expand the vector store interface to accommodate other data types like images, audio, and video.

# Output parsers

<span data-heading-keywords="output parser"></span>

:::note

The information here refers to parsers that take a text output from a model try to parse it into a more structured representation.
More and more models are supporting function (or tool) calling, which handles this automatically.
It is recommended to use function/tool calling rather than output parsing.
See documentation for that [here](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).

:::

Output parsers are responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks.
Useful when you are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.

LangChain has lots of different types of output parsers. This is a list of output parsers LangChain supports. The table below has various pieces of information:

- **Name**: The name of the output parser
- **Supports Streaming**: Whether the output parser supports streaming.
- **Has Format Instructions**: Whether the output parser has format instructions. This is generally available except when (a) the desired schema is not specified in the prompt but rather in other parameters (like OpenAI function calling), or (b) when the OutputParser wraps another OutputParser.
- **Calls LLM**: Whether this output parser itself calls an LLM. This is usually only done by output parsers that attempt to correct misformatted output.
- **Input Type**: Expected input type. Most output parsers work on both strings and messages, but some (like OpenAI Functions) need a message with specific kwargs.
- **Output Type**: The output type of the object returned by the parser.
- **Description**: Our commentary on this output parser and when to use it.

| Name | Supports Streaming | Has Format Instructions | Calls LLM | Input Type | Output Type | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [JSON](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.output_parsers.JsonOutputParser.html) | ✅ | ✅ | | `string` \| `Message` | JSON object | Returns a JSON object as specified. Probably the most reliable output parser for getting structured data that does NOT use function calling. |
| [XML](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.output_parsers.XMLOutputParser.html) | ✅ | ✅ | | `string` \| `Message` | `object` | Returns a object of tags. Use when XML output is needed. Use with models that are good at writing XML (like Anthropic's). |
| [CSV](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.output_parsers.CommaSeparatedListOutputParser.html) | ✅ | ✅ | | `string` \| `Message` | `Array<string>` | Returns a list of comma separated values. |
| [OutputFixing](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.output_parsers.OutputFixingParser.html) | | | ✅ | `string` \| `Message` | | Wraps another output parser. If that output parser errors, then this will pass the error message and the bad output to an LLM and ask it to fix the output. |
| [Datetime](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.output_parsers.DatetimeOutputParser.html) | | ✅ | | `string` \| `Message` | `Date` | Parses response into a datetime string. |
| [Structured](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.output_parsers.StructuredOutputParser.html) | | ✅ | | `string` \| `Message` | `Record<string, string>` | An output parser that returns structured information. It is less powerful than other output parsers since it only allows for fields to be strings. This can be useful when you are working with smaller LLMs. |

For specifics on how to use output parsers, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#output-parsers).

# Prompt Templates

Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model.
This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.

Prompt Templates take as input an object, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.

Prompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or a list of messages.
The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.

There are a few different types of prompt templates:

## String PromptTemplates

These prompt templates are used to format a single string, and generally are used for simpler inputs.
For example, a common way to construct and use a PromptTemplate is as follows:

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const promptTemplate = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
 "Tell me a joke about {topic}"
);

await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: "cats" });
```

```text
StringPromptValue {
 value: 'Tell me a joke about cats'
}
```

## ChatPromptTemplates

These prompt templates are used to format a list of messages. These "templates" consist of a list of templates themselves.
For example, a common way to construct and use a ChatPromptTemplate is as follows:

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
 ["system", "You are a helpful assistant"],
 ["user", "Tell me a joke about {topic}"],
]);

await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: "cats" });
```

```text
ChatPromptValue {
 messages: [
 SystemMessage {
 "content": "You are a helpful assistant",
 "additional_kwargs": {},
 "response_metadata": {}
 },
 HumanMessage {
 "content": "Tell me a joke about cats",
 "additional_kwargs": {},
 "response_metadata": {}
 }
 ]
}
```

In the above example, this ChatPromptTemplate will construct two messages when called.
The first is a system message, that has no variables to format.
The second is a HumanMessage, and will be formatted by the `topic` variable the user passes in.

## MessagesPlaceholder

<span data-heading-keywords="messagesplaceholder"></span>

This prompt template is responsible for adding a list of messages in a particular place.
In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw how we could format two messages, each one a string.
But what if we wanted the user to pass in a list of messages that we would slot into a particular spot?
This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder.

```typescript
import {
 ChatPromptTemplate,
 MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
 ["system", "You are a helpful assistant"],
 new MessagesPlaceholder("msgs"),
]);

await promptTemplate.invoke({ msgs: [new HumanMessage("hi!")] });
```

```text
ChatPromptValue {
 messages: [
 SystemMessage {
 "content": "You are a helpful assistant",
 "additional_kwargs": {},
 "response_metadata": {}
 },
 HumanMessage {
 "content": "hi!",
 "additional_kwargs": {},
 "response_metadata": {}
 }
 ]
}
```

This will produce a list of two messages, the first one being a system message, and the second one being the HumanMessage we passed in.
If we had passed in 5 messages, then it would have produced 6 messages in total (the system message plus the 5 passed in).
This is useful for letting a list of messages be slotted into a particular spot.

An alternative way to accomplish the same thing without using the `MessagesPlaceholder` class explicitly is:

```typescript
const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
 ["system", "You are a helpful assistant"],
 // highlight-next-line
 ["placeholder", "{msgs}"], // <-- This is the changed part
]);
```

For specifics on how to use prompt templates, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#prompt-templates).

# Retrieval augmented generation (rag)

:::info[Prerequisites]

- [Retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval/)

:::

## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) by combining them with external knowledge bases.
RAG addresses [a key limitation of models](https://www.glean.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ai-assistant-for-the-enterprise): models rely on fixed training datasets, which can lead to outdated or incomplete information.
When given a query, RAG systems first search a knowledge base for relevant information.
The system then incorporates this retrieved information into the model's prompt.
The model uses the provided context to generate a response to the query.
By bridging the gap between vast language models and dynamic, targeted information retrieval, RAG is a powerful technique for building more capable and reliable AI systems.

## Key concepts

![Conceptual Overview](/img/rag_concepts.png)

(1) **Retrieval system**: Retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base.

(2) **Adding external knowledge**: Pass retrieved information to a model.

## Retrieval system

Model's have internal knowledge that is often fixed, or at least not updated frequently due to the high cost of training.
This limits their ability to answer questions about current events, or to provide specific domain knowledge.
To address this, there are various knowledge injection techniques like [fine-tuning](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/fine_tuning_valuable.html) or continued pre-training.
Both are [costly](https://www.glean.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ai-assistant-for-the-enterprise) and often [poorly suited](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-is-for-form-not-facts) for factual retrieval.
Using a retrieval system offers several advantages:

- **Up-to-date information**: RAG can access and utilize the latest data, keeping responses current.
- **Domain-specific expertise**: With domain-specific knowledge bases, RAG can provide answers in specific domains.
- **Reduced hallucination**: Grounding responses in retrieved facts helps minimize false or invented information.
- **Cost-effective knowledge integration**: RAG offers a more efficient alternative to expensive model fine-tuning.

:::info[Further reading]

See our conceptual guide on [retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval/).

:::

## Adding external knowledge

With a retrieval system in place, we need to pass knowledge from this system to the model.
A RAG pipeline typically achieves this following these steps:

- Receive an input query.
- Use the retrieval system to search for relevant information based on the query.
- Incorporate the retrieved information into the prompt sent to the LLM.
- Generate a response that leverages the retrieved context.

As an example, here's a simple RAG workflow that passes information from a [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) to a [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/):

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// Define a system prompt that tells the model how to use the retrieved context
const systemPrompt = `You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.
Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
Context: {context}:`;

// Define a question
const question =
 "What are the main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system?";

// Retrieve relevant documents
const docs = await retriever.invoke(question);

// Combine the documents into a single string
const docsText = docs.map((d) => d.pageContent).join("");

// Populate the system prompt with the retrieved context
const systemPromptFmt = systemPrompt.replace("{context}", docsText);

// Create a model
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4o",
 temperature: 0,
});

// Generate a response
const questions = await model.invoke([
 {
 role: "system",
 content: systemPromptFmt,
 },
 {
 role: "user",
 content: question,
 },
]);
```

Some of the concepts reviewed here utilize models to generate queries (e.g., for SQL or graph databases).
There are inherent risks in doing this.
Make sure that your database connection permissions are scoped as narrowly as possible for your application's needs.
This will mitigate, though not eliminate, the risks of building a model-driven system capable of querying databases.

## Overview

Retrieval systems are fundamental to many AI applications, efficiently identifying relevant information from large datasets.
These systems accommodate various data formats:

- Unstructured text (e.g., documents) is often stored in vector stores or lexical search indexes.
- Structured data is typically housed in relational or graph databases with defined schemas.

Despite this diversity in data formats, modern AI applications increasingly aim to make all types of data accessible through natural language interfaces.
Models play a crucial role in this process by translating natural language queries into formats compatible with the underlying search index or database.
This translation enables more intuitive and flexible interactions with complex data structures.

## Key concepts

![Retrieval](/img/retrieval_concept.png)

(1) **Query analysis**: A process where models transform or construct search queries to optimize retrieval.

(2) **Information retrieval**: Search queries are used to fetch information from various retrieval systems.

## Query analysis

While users typically prefer to interact with retrieval systems using natural language, retrieval systems can specific query syntax or benefit from particular keywords.
Query analysis serves as a bridge between raw user input and optimized search queries. Some common applications of query analysis include:

1. **Query Re-writing**: Queries can be re-written or expanded to improve semantic or lexical searches.
2. **Query Construction**: Search indexes may require structured queries (e.g., SQL for databases).

Query analysis employs models to transform or construct optimized search queries from raw user input.

### Query re-writing

Retrieval systems should ideally handle a wide spectrum of user inputs, from simple and poorly worded queries to complex, multi-faceted questions.
To achieve this versatility, a popular approach is to use models to transform raw user queries into more effective search queries.
This transformation can range from simple keyword extraction to sophisticated query expansion and reformulation.
Here are some key benefits of using models for query analysis in unstructured data retrieval:

1. **Query Clarification**: Models can rephrase ambiguous or poorly worded queries for clarity.
2. **Semantic Understanding**: They can capture the intent behind a query, going beyond literal keyword matching.
3. **Query Expansion**: Models can generate related terms or concepts to broaden the search scope.
4. **Complex Query Handling**: They can break down multi-part questions into simpler sub-queries.

Various techniques have been developed to leverage models for query re-writing, including:

| Name | When to use | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Decomposition](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb) | When a question can be broken down into smaller subproblems. | Decompose a question into a set of subproblems / questions, which can either be solved sequentially (use the answer from first + retrieval to answer the second) or in parallel (consolidate each answer into final answer). |
| [Step-back](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb) | When a higher-level conceptual understanding is required. | First prompt the LLM to ask a generic step-back question about higher-level concepts or principles, and retrieve relevant facts about them. Use this grounding to help answer the user question. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117). |
| [HyDE](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/blob/main/rag_from_scratch_5_to_9.ipynb) | If you have challenges retrieving relevant documents using the raw user inputs. | Use an LLM to convert questions into hypothetical documents that answer the question. Use the embedded hypothetical documents to retrieve real documents with the premise that doc-doc similarity search can produce more relevant matches. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496). |

As an example, query decomposition can simply be accomplished using prompting and a structured output that enforces a list of sub-questions.
These can then be run sequentially or in parallel on a downstream retrieval system.

### Query construction

Query analysis also can focus on translating natural language queries into specialized query languages or filters.
This translation is crucial for effectively interacting with various types of databases that house structured or semi-structured data.

1. **Structured Data examples**: For relational and graph databases, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are used to query data.

 - **Text-to-SQL**: [Converts natural language to SQL](https://paperswithcode.com/task/text-to-sql) for relational databases.
 - **Text-to-Cypher**: [Converts natural language to Cypher](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.4/user-guide/extensions/natural-language-queries/) for graph databases.

2. **Semi-structured Data examples**: For vectorstores, queries can combine semantic search with metadata filtering.
 - **Natural Language to Metadata Filters**: Converts user queries into [appropriate metadata filters](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/filter-with-metadata).

These approaches leverage models to bridge the gap between user intent and the specific query requirements of different data storage systems. Here are some popular techniques:

| Name | When to Use | Description |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Self Query](/docs/how_to/self_query/) | If users are asking questions that are better answered by fetching documents based on metadata rather than similarity with the text. | This uses an LLM to transform user input into two things: (1) a string to look up semantically, (2) a metadata filter to go along with it. This is useful because oftentimes questions are about the METADATA of documents (not the content itself). |
| [Text to SQL](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/) | If users are asking questions that require information housed in a relational database, accessible via SQL. | This uses an LLM to transform user input into a SQL query. |
| [Text-to-Cypher](/docs/tutorials/graph/) | If users are asking questions that require information housed in a graph database, accessible via Cypher. | This uses an LLM to transform user input into a Cypher query. |

As an example, here is how to use the `SelfQueryRetriever` to convert natural language queries into metadata filters.

```typescript
import { SelfQueryRetriever } from "langchain/retrievers/self_query";
import { AttributeInfo } from "langchain/chains/query_constructor";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const attributeInfo: AttributeInfo[] = schemaForMetadata;
const documentContents = "Brief summary of a movie";
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 });
const retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.fromLLM({
 llm,
 vectorStore,
 documentContents,
 attributeInfo,
});
```

## Information retrieval

### Common retrieval systems

#### Lexical search indexes

Many search engines are based upon matching words in a query to the words in each document.
This approach is called lexical retrieval, using search [algorithms that are typically based upon word frequencies](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-ai-powered-vector-search?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2).
The intution is simple: a word appears frequently both in the user’s query and a particular document, then this document might be a good match.

The particular data structure used to implement this is often an [_inverted index_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inverted-index/).
This types of index contains a list of words and a mapping of each word to a list of locations at which it occurs in various documents.
Using this data structure, it is possible to efficiently match the words in search queries to the documents in which they appear.
[BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#:~:text=BM25%20is%20a%20bag%2Dof,slightly%20different%20components%20and%20parameters.) and [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) are [two popular lexical search algorithms](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-ai-powered-vector-search?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2).

:::info[Further reading]

:::

#### Vector indexes

Vector indexes are an alternative way to index and store unstructured data.
See our conceptual guide on [vectorstores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores/) for a detailed overview. 
In short, rather than using word frequencies, vectorstores use an [embedding model](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/) to compress documents into high-dimensional vector representation.
This allows for efficient similarity search over embedding vectors using simple mathematical operations like cosine similarity.

- See Cameron Wolfe's [blog post](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-ai-powered-vector-search?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) on the basics of vector search.

:::

#### Relational databases

Relational databases are a fundamental type of structured data storage used in many applications.
They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each table represents an entity or relationship.
Data is stored in rows (records) and columns (attributes), allowing for efficient querying and manipulation through SQL (Structured Query Language).
Relational databases excel at maintaining data integrity, supporting complex queries, and handling relationships between different data entities.

:::info[Further reading]

- See our [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/) for working with SQL databases.

:::

#### Graph databases

Graph databases are a specialized type of database designed to store and manage highly interconnected data.
Unlike traditional relational databases, graph databases use a flexible structure consisting of nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and properties.
This structure allows for efficient representation and querying of complex, interconnected data.
Graph databases store data in a graph structure, with nodes, edges, and properties.
They are particularly useful for storing and querying complex relationships between data points, such as social networks, supply-chain management, fraud detection, and recommendation services

### Retriever

LangChain provides a unified interface for interacting with various retrieval systems through the [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) concept. The interface is straightforward:

1. Input: A query (string)
2. Output: A list of documents (standardized LangChain [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects)

You can create a retriever using any of the retrieval systems mentioned earlier. The query analysis techniques we discussed are particularly useful here, as they enable natural language interfaces for databases that typically require structured query languages.
For example, you can build a retriever for a SQL database using text-to-SQL conversion. This allows a natural language query (string) to be transformed into a SQL query behind the scenes.
Regardless of the underlying retrieval system, all retrievers in LangChain share a common interface. You can use them with the simple `invoke` method:

```typescript
const docs = await retriever.invoke(query);
```

## Overview

Many different types of retrieval systems exist, including vectorstores, graph databases, and relational databases.
With the rise on popularity of large language models, retrieval systems have become an important component in AI application (e.g., [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag/)).
Because of their importance and variability, LangChain provides a uniform interface for interacting with different types of retrieval systems.
The LangChain [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) interface is straightforward:

1. Input: A query (string)
2. Output: A list of documents (standardized LangChain [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects)

## Key concept

![Retriever](/img/retriever_concept.png)

All retrievers implement a simple interface for retrieving documents using natural language queries.

## Interface

The only requirement for a retriever is the ability to accepts a query and return documents.
In particular, [LangChain's retriever class](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html) only requires that the `_getRelevantDocuments` method is implemented, which takes a `query: string` and returns a list of [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects that are most relevant to the query.
The underlying logic used to get relevant documents is specified by the retriever and can be whatever is most useful for the application.

A LangChain retriever is a [runnable](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/), which is a standard interface is for LangChain components.
This means that it has a few common methods, including `invoke`, that are used to interact with it. A retriever can be invoked with a query:

```typescript
const docs = await retriever.invoke(query);
```

Retrievers return a list of [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects, which have two attributes:

- `pageContent`: The content of this document. Currently is a string.
- `metadata`: Arbitrary metadata associated with this document (e.g., document id, file name, source, etc).

:::info[Further reading]

- See our [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/) on building your own custom retriever.

:::

## Common types

Despite the flexibility of the retriever interface, a few common types of retrieval systems are frequently used.

### Search apis

It's important to note that retrievers don't need to actually _store_ documents.
For example, we can be built retrievers on top of search APIs that simply return search results!

### Relational or graph database

Retrievers can be built on top of relational or graph databases.
In these cases, [query analysis](/docs/concepts/retrieval/) techniques to construct a structured query from natural language is critical.
For example, you can build a retriever for a SQL database using text-to-SQL conversion. This allows a natural language query (string) retriever to be transformed into a SQL query behind the scenes.

:::info[Further reading]

- See our [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/) for context on how to build a retreiver using a SQL database and text-to-SQL.
- See our [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/graph/) for context on how to build a retreiver using a graph database and text-to-Cypher.

:::

### Lexical search

As discussed in our conceptual review of [retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval/), many search engines are based upon matching words in a query to the words in each document.
[BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#:~:text=BM25%20is%20a%20bag%2Dof,slightly%20different%20components%20and%20parameters.) and [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) are [two popular lexical search algorithms](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-ai-powered-vector-search?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2).
LangChain has retrievers for many popular lexical search algorithms / engines.

:::info[Further reading]

- See the [BM25](/docs/integrations/retrievers/bm25/) retriever integration.

:::

### Vector store

[Vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores/) are a powerful and efficient way to index and retrieve unstructured data.
An vectorstore can be used as a retriever by calling the `asRetriever()` method.

```typescript
const vectorstore = new MyVectorStore();
const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever();
```

## Advanced retrieval patterns

### Ensemble

Because the retriever interface is so simple, returning a list of `Document` objects given a search query, it is possible to combine multiple retrievers using ensembling.
This is particularly useful when you have multiple retrievers that are good at finding different types of relevant documents.
It is easy to create an [ensemble retriever](/docs/how_to/ensemble_retriever/) that combines multiple retrievers with linear weighted scores:

```typescript
// Initialize the ensemble retriever
const ensembleRetriever = new EnsembleRetriever({
 retrievers: [bm25Retriever, vectorStoreRetriever],
 weights: [0.5, 0.5],
});
```

When ensembling, how do we combine search results from many retrievers?
This motivates the concept of re-ranking, which takes the output of multiple retrievers and combines them using a more sophisticated algorithm such as [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf).

### Source document retention

Many retrievers utilize some kind of index to make documents easily searchable.
The process of indexing can include a transformation step (e.g., vectorstores often use document splitting).
Whatever transformation is used, can be very useful to retain a link between the _transformed document_ and the original, giving the retriever the ability to return the _original_ document.

![Retrieval with full docs](/img/retriever_full_docs.png)

This is particularly useful in AI applications, because it ensures no loss in document context for the model.
For example, you may use small chunk size for indexing documents in a vectorstore.
If you return _only_ the chunks as the retrieval result, then the model will have lost the original document context for the chunks.

LangChain has two different retrievers that can be used to address this challenge.
The [Multi-Vector](/docs/how_to/multi_vector/) retriever allows the user to use any document transformation (e.g., use an LLM to write a summary of the document) for indexing while retaining linkage to the source document.
The [ParentDocument](/docs/how_to/parent_document_retriever/) retriever links document chunks from a text-splitter transformation for indexing while retaining linkage to the source document.

| Name | Index Type | Uses an LLM | When to Use | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [ParentDocument](/docs/how_to/parent_document_retriever/) | Vector store + Document Store | No | If your pages have lots of smaller pieces of distinct information that are best indexed by themselves, but best retrieved all together. | This involves indexing multiple chunks for each document. Then you find the chunks that are most similar in embedding space, but you retrieve the whole parent document and return that (rather than individual chunks). |
| [Multi Vector](/docs/how_to/multi_vector/) | Vector store + Document Store | Sometimes during indexing | If you are able to extract information from documents that you think is more relevant to index than the text itself. | This involves creating multiple vectors for each document. Each vector could be created in a myriad of ways - examples include summaries of the text and hypothetical questions. |

# Runnable interface

The Runnable interface is foundational for working with LangChain components, and it's implemented across many of them, such as [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models), [output parsers](/docs/concepts/output_parsers), [retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers), [compiled LangGraph graphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/#compiling-your-graph) and more.

This guide covers the main concepts and methods of the Runnable interface, which allows developers to interact with various LangChain components in a consistent and predictable manner.

:::info Related Resources

- The ["Runnable" Interface API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html) provides a detailed overview of the Runnable interface and its methods.
- A list of built-in `Runnables` can be found in the [LangChain Core API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/_langchain_core.runnables.html). Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom "chains" in LangChain using the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel).

:::

## Overview of runnable interface

The Runnable way defines a standard interface that allows a Runnable component to be:

- [Invoked](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/#invoke-a-runnable): A single input is transformed into an output.
- [Batched](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/#batch-a-runnable/): Multiple inputs are efficiently transformed into outputs.
- [Streamed](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/#stream-a-runnable): Outputs are streamed as they are produced.
- Inspected: Schematic information about Runnable's input, output, and configuration can be accessed.
- Composed: Multiple Runnables can be composed to work together using [the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel) to create complex pipelines.

Please review the [LCEL Cheatsheet](/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet) for some common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.

### Optimized parallel execution (batch)

LangChain Runnables offer a built-in `batch` API that allow you to process multiple inputs in parallel.

Using this method can significantly improve performance when needing to process multiple independent inputs, as the
processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.

The batching method is:

- `batch`: Process multiple inputs in parallel, returning results in the same order as the inputs.

The default implementation of `batch` executed the `invoke` method in parallel.

Some Runnables may provide their own implementations of `batch` that are optimized for their specific use case (e.g.,
rely on a `batch` API provided by a model provider).

:::tip
When processing a large number of inputs using `batch`, users may want to control the maximum number of parallel calls. This can be done by setting the `maxConcurrency` attribute in the `RunnableConfig` object. See the [RunnableConfig](/docs/concepts/runnables#RunnableConfig) for more information.
:::

## Streaming apis

<span data-heading-keywords="streaming-api"></span>

Streaming is critical in making applications based on LLMs feel responsive to end-users.

Runnables expose the following three streaming APIs:

1. [`stream`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#stream): yields the output a Runnable as it is generated.
2. [`streamEvents`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#streamEvents): a more advanced streaming API that allows streaming intermediate steps and final output
3. **legacy** `streamLog`: a legacy streaming API that streams intermediate steps and final output

Please refer to the [Streaming Conceptual Guide](/docs/concepts/streaming) for more details on how to stream in LangChain.

## Input and output types

Every `Runnable` is characterized by an input and output type. These input and output types can be any TypeScript object, and are defined by the Runnable itself.

Runnable methods that result in the execution of the Runnable (e.g., `invoke`, `batch`, `stream`, `streamEvents`) work with these input and output types.

- `invoke`: Accepts an input and returns an output.
- `batch`: Accepts a list of inputs and returns a list of outputs.
- `stream`: Accepts an input and returns a generator that yields outputs.

The **input type** and **output type** vary by component:

| Component | Input Type | Output Type |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Prompt | `object` | `PromptValue` |
| ChatModel | a `string`, list of chat messages or a `PromptValue` | `ChatMessage` |
| LLM | a `string`, list of chat messages or a `PromptValue` | `string` |
| OutputParser | the output of an LLM or ChatModel | Depends on the parser |
| Retriever | a `string` | List of `Document`s |
| Tool | a `string` or `object`, depending on the tool | Depends on the tool |

Please refer to the individual component documentation for more information on the input and output types and how to use them.

## RunnableConfig

Any of the methods that are used to execute the runnable (e.g., `invoke`, `batch`, `stream`, `streamEvents`) accept a second argument called
`RunnableConfig` ([API Reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.html)). This argument is an object that contains configuration for the Runnable that will be used
at run time during the execution of the runnable.

A `RunnableConfig` can have any of the following properties defined:

| Attribute | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `runName` | Name used for the given Runnable (not inherited). |
| `runId` | Unique identifier for this call. sub-calls will get their own unique run ids. |
| `tags` | Tags for this call and any sub-calls. |
| `metadata` | Metadata for this call and any sub-calls. |
| `callbacks` | Callbacks for this call and any sub-calls. |
| `maxConcurrency` | Maximum number of parallel calls to make (e.g., used by batch). |
| `recursionLimit` | Maximum number of times a call can recurse (e.g., used by Runnables that return Runnables) |
| `configurable` | Runtime values for configurable attributes of the Runnable. |

Passing `config` to the `invoke` method is done like so:

```typescript
await someRunnable.invoke(someInput, {
 runName: "myRun",
 tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
 metadata: { key: "value" },
});
```

### Propagation of RunnableConfig

Many `Runnables` are composed of other Runnables, and it is important that the `RunnableConfig` is propagated to all sub-calls made by the Runnable. This allows providing run time configuration values to the parent Runnable that are inherited by all sub-calls.

If this were not the case, it would be impossible to set and propagate [callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks) or other configuration values like `tags` and `metadata` which
are expected to be inherited by all sub-calls.

There are two main patterns by which new `Runnables` are created:

1. Declaratively using [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel):

 ```typescript
 const chain = prompt.pipe(chatModel).pipe(outputParser);
 ```

2. Using a [custom Runnable](#custom-runnables) (e.g., `RunnableLambda`) or using the `tool` function:

 ```typescript
 const foo = (input) => {
 // Note that .invoke() is used directly here
 // highlight-next-line
 return barRunnable.invoke(input);
 };
 const fooRunnable = RunnableLambda.from(foo);
 ```

LangChain will try to propagate `RunnableConfig` automatically for both of the patterns.

Propagating the `RunnableConfig` manually is done like so:

```typescript
// Note the config argument
// highlight-next-line
const foo = (input, config) => {
 return barRunnable.invoke(input, config);
};
const fooRunnable = RunnableLambda.from(foo);
```

### Setting custom run name, tags, and metadata

The `runName`, `tags`, and `metadata` attributes of the `RunnableConfig` object can be used to set custom values for the run name, tags, and metadata for a given Runnable.

The `runName` is a string that can be used to set a custom name for the run. This name will be used in logs and other places to identify the run. It is not inherited by sub-calls.

The `tags` and `metadata` attributes are arrays and objects, respectively, that can be used to set custom tags and metadata for the run. These values are inherited by sub-calls.

Using these attributes can be useful for tracking and debugging runs, as they will be surfaced in [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) as trace attributes that you can
filter and search on.

The attributes will also be propagated to [callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks), and will appear in streaming APIs like [streamEvents](/docs/concepts/streaming) as part of each event in the stream.

:::

### Setting run id

:::note
This is an advanced feature that is unnecessary for most users.
:::

You may need to set a custom `runId` for a given run, in case you want
to reference it later or correlate it with other systems.

The `runId` MUST be a valid UUID string and **unique** for each run. It is used to identify
the parent run, sub-class will get their own unique run ids automatically.

To set a custom `runId`, you can pass it as a key-value pair in the `config` object when invoking the Runnable:

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

const runId = uuidv4();

await someRunnable.invoke(someInput, {
 runId,
});

// Do something with the runId
```

### Setting recursion limit

:::note
This is an advanced feature that is unnecessary for most users.
:::

Some Runnables may return other Runnables, which can lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly. To prevent this, you can set a `recursion_limit` in the `RunnableConfig` object. This will limit the number of times a Runnable can recurse.

### Setting max concurrency

If using the `batch` methods, you can set the `maxConcurrency` attribute in the `RunnableConfig` object to control the maximum number of parallel calls to make. This can be useful when you want to limit the number of parallel calls to prevent overloading a server or API.

### Setting configurable

The `configurable` field is used to pass runtime values for configurable attributes of the Runnable.

It is used frequently in [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) with
[LangGraph Persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/persistence/)
and [memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/).

It is used for a similar purpose in [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html) to specify
a `session_id` to keep track of conversation history.

### Setting callbacks

Use this option to configure [callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks) for the runnable at
runtime. The callbacks will be passed to all sub-calls made by the runnable.

```typescript
await someRunnable.invoke(someInput, {
 callbacks: [SomeCallbackHandler(), AnotherCallbackHandler()],
});
```

Please read the [Callbacks Conceptual Guide](/docs/concepts/callbacks) for more information on how to use callbacks in LangChain.

## Creating a runnable from a function

You may need to create a custom Runnable that runs arbitrary logic. This is especially
useful if using [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel) to compose
multiple Runnables and you need to add custom processing logic in one of the steps.

There are two ways to create a custom Runnable from a function:

- `RunnableLambda`: Use this simple transformations where streaming is not required.
- `RunnableGenerator`: use this for more complex transformations when streaming is needed.

See the [How to run custom functions](/docs/how_to/functions) guide for more information on how to use `RunnableLambda` and `RunnableGenerator`.

:::important
Users should not try to subclass Runnables to create a new custom Runnable. It is
much more complex and error-prone than simply using `RunnableLambda` or `RunnableGenerator`.

# Streaming

:::info Prerequisites

- [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)
- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

:::

**Streaming** is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on [LLMs](/docs/concepts/chat_models). By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.

## Overview

Generating full responses from [LLMs](/docs/concepts/chat_models) often incurs a delay of several seconds, which becomes more noticeable in complex applications with multiple model calls. Fortunately, LLMs generate responses iteratively, allowing for intermediate results to be displayed as they are produced. By streaming these intermediate outputs, LangChain enables smoother UX in LLM-powered apps and offers built-in support for streaming at the core of its design.

In this guide, we'll discuss streaming in LLM applications and explore how LangChain's streaming APIs facilitate real-time output from various components in your application.

## What to stream in LLM applications

In applications involving LLMs, several types of data can be streamed to improve user experience by reducing perceived latency and increasing transparency. These include:

### 1. Streaming LLM outputs

The most common and critical data to stream is the output generated by the LLM itself. LLMs often take time to generate full responses, and by streaming the output in real-time, users can see partial results as they are produced. This provides immediate feedback and helps reduce the wait time for users.

### 2. Streaming pipeline or workflow progress

Beyond just streaming LLM output, it’s useful to stream progress through more complex workflows or pipelines, giving users a sense of how the application is progressing overall. This could include:

- **In LangGraph Workflows:**
 With [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph), workflows are composed of nodes and edges that represent various steps. Streaming here involves tracking changes to the **graph state** as individual **nodes** request updates. This allows for more granular monitoring of which node in the workflow is currently active, giving real-time updates about the status of the workflow as it progresses through different stages.

- **In LCEL Pipelines:**
 Streaming updates from an [LCEL](/docs/concepts/lcel) pipeline involves capturing progress from individual **sub-runnables**. For example, as different steps or components of the pipeline execute, you can stream which sub-runnable is currently running, providing real-time insight into the overall pipeline's progress.

Streaming pipeline or workflow progress is essential in providing users with a clear picture of where the application is in the execution process.

### 3. Streaming custom data

In some cases, you may need to stream **custom data** that goes beyond the information provided by the pipeline or workflow structure. This custom information is injected within a specific step in the workflow, whether that step is a tool or a LangGraph node. For example, you could stream updates about what a tool is doing in real-time or the progress through a LangGraph node. This granular data, which is emitted directly from within the step, provides more detailed insights into the execution of the workflow and is especially useful in complex processes where more visibility is needed.

## Streaming APIs

LangChain two main APIs for streaming output in real-time. These APIs are supported by any component that implements the [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables), including [LLMs](/docs/concepts/chat_models), [compiled LangGraph graphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/), and any Runnable generated with [LCEL](/docs/concepts/lcel).

1. [`stream`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#stream): Use to stream outputs from individual Runnables (e.g., a chat model) as they are generated or stream any workflow created with LangGraph.
2. [`streamEvents`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#streamEvents): Use this API to get access to custom events and intermediate outputs from LLM applications built entirely with [LCEL](/docs/concepts/lcel). Note that this API is available, but not needed when working with LangGraph.

:::note
In addition, there is a **legacy** [streamLog](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#streamLog) API. This API is not recommended for new projects it is more complex and less feature-rich than the other streaming APIs.
:::

### `stream()`

The `stream()` method returns an iterator that yields chunks of output synchronously as they are produced. You can use a `for await` loop to process each chunk in real-time. For example, when using an LLM, this allows the output to be streamed incrementally as it is generated, reducing the wait time for users.

The type of chunk yielded by the `stream()` methods depends on the component being streamed. For example, when streaming from an [LLM](/docs/concepts/chat_models) each component will be an [`AIMessageChunk`](/docs/concepts/messages#aimessagechunk); however, for other components, the chunk may be different.

The `stream()` method returns an iterator that yields these chunks as they are produced. For example,

```typescript
for await (const chunk of await component.stream(someInput)) {
 // IMPORTANT: Keep the processing of each chunk as efficient as possible.
 // While you're processing the current chunk, the upstream component is
 // waiting to produce the next one. For example, if working with LangGraph,
 // graph execution is paused while the current chunk is being processed.
 // In extreme cases, this could even result in timeouts (e.g., when llm outputs are
 // streamed from an API that has a timeout).
 console.log(chunk);
}
```

#### Usage with chat models

When using `stream()` with chat models, the output is streamed as [`AIMessageChunks`](/docs/concepts/messages#aimessagechunk) as it is generated by the LLM. This allows you to present or process the LLM's output incrementally as it's being produced, which is particularly useful in interactive applications or interfaces.

#### Usage with LangGraph

[LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) compiled graphs are [Runnables](/docs/concepts/runnables) and support the standard streaming APIs.

When using the _stream_ and methods with LangGraph, you can **one or more** [streaming mode](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph_pregel.Pregel.html#streamMode) which allow you to control the type of output that is streamed. The available streaming modes are:

- **"values"**: Emit all values of the [state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/) for each step.
- **"updates"**: Emit only the node name(s) and updates that were returned by the node(s) after each step.
- **"debug"**: Emit debug events for each step.
- **"messages"**: Emit LLM [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) [token-by-token](/docs/concepts/tokens).

For more information, please see:

- [LangGraph streaming conceptual guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/streaming/) for more information on how to stream when working with LangGraph.
- [LangGraph streaming how-to guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/#streaming) for specific examples of streaming in LangGraph.

#### Usage with LCEL

If you compose multiple Runnables using [LangChain’s Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel), the `stream()` methods will, by convention, stream the output of the last step in the chain. This allows the final processed result to be streamed incrementally. **LCEL** tries to optimize streaming latency in pipelines such that the streaming results from the last step are available as soon as possible.

### `streamEvents`

<span data-heading-keywords="streamEvents,stream_events,stream events"></span>

:::tip
Use the `streamEvents` API to access custom data and intermediate outputs from LLM applications built entirely with [LCEL](/docs/concepts/lcel).

While this API is available for use with [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) as well, it is usually not necessary when working with LangGraph, as the `stream` methods provide comprehensive streaming capabilities for LangGraph graphs.
:::

For chains constructed using **LCEL**, the `.stream()` method only streams the output of the final step from te chain. This might be sufficient for some applications, but as you build more complex chains of several LLM calls together, you may want to use the intermediate values of the chain alongside the final output. For example, you may want to return sources alongside the final generation when building a chat-over-documents app.

There are ways to do this [using callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks), or by constructing your chain in such a way that it passes intermediate
values to the end with something like chained [`.assign()`](/docs/how_to/passthrough/) calls, but LangChain also includes an
`.streamEvents()` method that combines the flexibility of callbacks with the ergonomics of `.stream()`. When called, it returns an iterator
which yields [various types of events](/docs/how_to/streaming/#event-reference) that you can filter and process according
to the needs of your project.

Here's one small example that prints just events containing streamed chat model output:

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const model = new ChatAnthropic({ model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229" });

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate("tell me a joke about {topic}");
const parser = StringOutputParser();
const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(parser);

for await (const event of await chain.streamEvents(
 { topic: "parrot" },
 { version: "v2" }
)) {
 if (event.event === "on_chat_model_stream") {
 console.log(event);
 }
}
```

You can roughly think of it as an iterator over callback events (though the format differs) - and you can use it on almost all LangChain components!

See [this guide](/docs/how_to/streaming/#using-stream-events) for more detailed information on how to use `.streamEvents()`, including a table listing available events.

## Writing custom data to the stream

To write custom data to the stream, you will need to choose one of the following methods based on the component you are working with:

1. [dispatch_events](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/_langchain_core.callbacks_dispatch.dispatchCustomEvent.html#) can be used to write custom data that will be surfaced through the **streamEvents** API. See [how to dispatch custom callback events](/docs/how_to/callbacks_custom_events/#stream-events-api) for more information.

## "Auto-Streaming" Chat Models

LangChain simplifies streaming from [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) by automatically enabling streaming mode in certain cases, even when you're not explicitly calling the streaming methods. This is particularly useful when you use the non-streaming `invoke` method but still want to stream the entire application, including intermediate results from the chat model.

### How It Works

When you call the `invoke` method on a chat model, LangChain will automatically switch to streaming mode if it detects that you are trying to stream the overall application.

Under the hood, it'll have `invoke` use the `stream` method to generate its output. The result of the invocation will be the same as far as the code that was using `invoke` is concerned; however, while the chat model is being streamed, LangChain will take care of invoking `on_llm_new_token` events in LangChain's [callback system](/docs/concepts/callbacks). These callback events
allow LangGraph `stream` and `streamEvents` to surface the chat model's output in real-time.

Example:

```typescript
const node = (state) => {
 ...
 // The code below uses the invoke method, but LangChain will
 // automatically switch to streaming mode
 // when it detects that the overall
 // application is being streamed.
 ai_message = model.invoke(state["messages"])
 ...

 for await (const chunk of await compiledGraph.stream(..., { streamMode: "messages" })) {
 // ... do something
 }
}
```

# Structured outputs

## Overview

For many applications, such as chatbots, models need to respond to users directly in natural language.
However, there are scenarios where we need models to output in a _structured format_.
For example, we might want to store the model output in a database and ensure that the output conforms to the database schema.
This need motivates the concept of structured output, where models can be instructed to respond with a particular output structure.

![Structured output](/img/structured_output.png)

## Key concepts

**(1) Schema definition:** The output structure is represented as a schema, which can be defined in several ways.
**(2) Returning structured output:** The model is given this schema, and is instructed to return output that conforms to it.

## Recommended usage

This pseudo-code illustrates the recommended workflow when using structured output.
LangChain provides a method, [`withStructuredOutput()`](/docs/how_to/structured_output/#the-.withstructuredoutput-method), that automates the process of binding the schema to the [model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) and parsing the output.
This helper function is available for all model providers that support structured output.

```typescript
// Define schema
const schema = { foo: "bar" };
// Bind schema to model
const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(schema);
// Invoke the model to produce structured output that matches the schema
const structuredOutput = await modelWithStructure.invoke(userInput);
```

## Schema definition

The central concept is that the output structure of model responses needs to be represented in some way.
While types of objects you can use depend on the model you're working with, there are common types of objects that are typically allowed or recommended for structured output in TypeScript.

The simplest and most common format for structured output is a Zod schema definition:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const ResponseFormatter = z.object({
 answer: z.string().describe("The answer to the user's question"),
 followup_question: z
 .string()
 .describe("A followup question the user could ask"),
});
```

You can also define a JSONSchema object, which is what Zod schemas are converted to internally before being sent to the model provider:

```json
{
 "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
 "$id": "https://example.com/product.schema.json",
 "title": "ResponseFormatter",
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "answer": {
 "description": "The answer to the user's question",
 "type": "string"
 },
 "followup_question": {
 "description": "A followup question the user could ask",
 "type": "string"
 }
 },
 "required": ["answer", "followup_question"]
}
```

## Returning structured output

With a schema defined, we need a way to instruct the model to use it.
While one approach is to include this schema in the prompt and _ask nicely_ for the model to use it, this is not recommended.
Several more powerful methods that utilizes native features in the model provider's API are available.

### Using tool calling

Many [model providers support](/docs/integrations/chat/) tool calling, a concept discussed in more detail in our [tool calling guide](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/).
In short, tool calling involves binding a tool to a model and, when appropriate, the model can _decide_ to call this tool and ensure its response conforms to the tool's schema.
With this in mind, the central concept is straightforward: _create a tool with our schema and bind it to the model!_
Here is an example using the `ResponseFormatter` schema defined above:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
 modelName: "gpt-4",
 temperature: 0,
});

// Create a tool with ResponseFormatter as its schema.
const responseFormatterTool = tool(async () => {}, {
 name: "responseFormatter",
 schema: ResponseFormatter,
});

// Bind the created tool to the model
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([responseFormatterTool]);

// Invoke the model
const aiMsg = await modelWithTools.invoke(
 "What is the powerhouse of the cell?"
);
```

### JSON mode

In addition to tool calling, some model providers support a feature called `JSON mode`.
This supports JSON schema definition as input and enforces the model to produce a conforming JSON output.
You can find a table of model providers that support JSON mode [here](/docs/integrations/chat/).
Here is an example of how to use JSON mode with OpenAI:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4",
}).bind({
 response_format: { type: "json_object" },
});

const aiMsg = await model.invoke(
 "Return a JSON object with key 'random_nums' and a value of 10 random numbers in [0-99]"
);
console.log(aiMsg.content);
// Output: {
// "random_nums": [23, 47, 89, 15, 34, 76, 58, 3, 62, 91]
// }
```

One important point to flag: the model _still_ returns a string, which needs to be parsed into a JSON object.
This can, of course, simply use the `json` library or a JSON output parser if you need more advanced functionality.
See this [how-to guide on the JSON output parser](/docs/how_to/output_parser_json) for more details.

```typescript
import json
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(aiMsg.content)
// {'random_ints': [23, 47, 89, 15, 34, 76, 58, 3, 62, 91]}
```

## Structured output method

There are a few challenges when producing structured output with the above methods:

(1) If using tool calling, tool call arguments needs to be parsed from an object back to the original schema.

(2) In addition, the model needs to be instructed to _always_ use the tool when we want to enforce structured output, which is a provider specific setting.

(3) If using JSON mode, the output needs to be parsed into a JSON object.

With these challenges in mind, LangChain provides a helper function (`withStructuredOutput()`) to streamline the process.

![Diagram of with structured output](/img/with_structured_output.png)

This both binds the schema to the model as a tool and parses the output to the specified output schema.

```typescript
// Bind the schema to the model
const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(ResponseFormatter);
// Invoke the model
const structuredOutput = await modelWithStructure.invoke(
 "What is the powerhouse of the cell?"
);
// Get back the object
console.log(structuredOutput);
// { answer: "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are organelles that generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy.", followup_question: "What is the function of ATP in the cell?" }
```

You are probably looking for the [Chat Model Concept Guide](/docs/concepts/chat_models) page for more information.
:::

LangChain has implementations for older language models that take a string as input and return a string as output. These models are typically named without the "Chat" prefix (e.g., `Ollama`, `Anthropic`, `OpenAI`, etc.), and may include the "LLM" suffix (e.g., `OpenAILLM`, etc.). These models implement the [`BaseLLM`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_llms.BaseLLM.html) interface.

Users should be using almost exclusively the newer [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) as most
model providers have adopted a chat like interface for interacting with language models.

## Overview

Document splitting is often a crucial preprocessing step for many applications.
It involves breaking down large texts into smaller, manageable chunks.
This process offers several benefits, such as ensuring consistent processing of varying document lengths, overcoming input size limitations of models, and improving the quality of text representations used in retrieval systems.
There are several strategies for splitting documents, each with its own advantages.

## Key concepts

![Conceptual Overview](/img/text_splitters.png)

Text splitters split documents into smaller chunks for use in downstream applications.

## Why split documents?

There are several reasons to split documents:

- **Handling non-uniform document lengths**: Real-world document collections often contain texts of varying sizes. Splitting ensures consistent processing across all documents.
- **Overcoming model limitations**: Many embedding models and language models have maximum input size constraints. Splitting allows us to process documents that would otherwise exceed these limits.
- **Improving representation quality**: For longer documents, the quality of embeddings or other representations may degrade as they try to capture too much information. Splitting can lead to more focused and accurate representations of each section.
- **Enhancing retrieval precision**: In information retrieval systems, splitting can improve the granularity of search results, allowing for more precise matching of queries to relevant document sections.
- **Optimizing computational resources**: Working with smaller chunks of text can be more memory-efficient and allow for better parallelization of processing tasks.

Now, the next question is _how_ to split the documents into chunks! There are several strategies, each with its own advantages.

:::info[Further reading]

- See Greg Kamradt's [chunkviz](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/) to visualize different splitting strategies discussed below.

:::

## Approaches

### Length-based

The most intuitive strategy is to split documents based on their length. This simple yet effective approach ensures that each chunk doesn't exceed a specified size limit.
Key benefits of length-based splitting:

- Straightforward implementation
- Consistent chunk sizes
- Easily adaptable to different model requirements

Types of length-based splitting:

- **Token-based**: Splits text based on the number of tokens, which is useful when working with language models.
- **Character-based**: Splits text based on the number of characters, which can be more consistent across different types of text.

Example implementation using LangChain's `CharacterTextSplitter` with character based splitting:

```typescript
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";
const textSplitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
 chunkSize: 100,
 chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const texts = await textSplitter.splitText(document);
```

:::info[Further reading]

- See the how-to guide for [token-based](/docs/how_to/split_by_token/) splitting.
- See the how-to guide for [character-based](/docs/how_to/character_text_splitter/) splitting.

:::

### Text-structured based

Text is naturally organized into hierarchical units such as paragraphs, sentences, and words.
We can leverage this inherent structure to inform our splitting strategy, creating split that maintain natural language flow, maintain semantic coherence within split, and adapts to varying levels of text granularity.
LangChain's [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/) implements this concept:

- The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` attempts to keep larger units (e.g., paragraphs) intact.
- If a unit exceeds the chunk size, it moves to the next level (e.g., sentences).
- This process continues down to the word level if necessary.

Here is example usage:

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
 chunkSize: 100,
 chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const texts = await textSplitter.splitText(document);
```

:::info[Further reading]

- See the how-to guide for [recursive text splitting](/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/).

:::

### Document-structured based

Some documents have an inherent structure, such as HTML, Markdown, or JSON files.
In these cases, it's beneficial to split the document based on its structure, as it often naturally groups semantically related text.
Key benefits of structure-based splitting:

- Preserves the logical organization of the document
- Maintains context within each chunk
- Can be more effective for downstream tasks like retrieval or summarization

Examples of structure-based splitting:

- **Markdown**: Split based on headers (e.g., #, ##, ###)
- **HTML**: Split using tags
- **JSON**: Split by object or array elements
- **Code**: Split by functions, classes, or logical blocks

:::info[Further reading]

- See the how-to guide for [Code splitting](/docs/how_to/code_splitter/).

:::

### Semantic meaning based

Unlike the previous methods, semantic-based splitting actually considers the _content_ of the text.
While other approaches use document or text structure as proxies for semantic meaning, this method directly analyzes the text's semantics.
There are several ways to implement this, but conceptually the approach is split text when there are significant changes in text _meaning_.
As an example, we can use a sliding window approach to generate embeddings, and compare the embeddings to find significant differences:

- Start with the first few sentences and generate an embedding.
- Move to the next group of sentences and generate another embedding (e.g., using a sliding window approach).
- Compare the embeddings to find significant differences, which indicate potential "break points" between semantic sections.

This technique helps create chunks that are more semantically coherent, potentially improving the quality of downstream tasks like retrieval or summarization.

:::info[Further reading]

- See Greg Kamradt's [notebook](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/main/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb) showcasing semantic splitting.

# Tokens

Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically based on a transformer architecture that processes a sequence of units known as tokens. Tokens are the fundamental elements that models use to break down input and generate output. In this section, we'll discuss what tokens are and how they are used by language models.

## What is a token?

A **token** is the basic unit that a language model reads, processes, and generates. These units can vary based on how the model provider defines them, but in general, they could represent:

- A whole word (e.g., "apple"),
- A part of a word (e.g., "app"),
- Or other linguistic components such as punctuation or spaces.

The way the model tokenizes the input depends on its **tokenizer algorithm**, which converts the input into tokens. Similarly, the model’s output comes as a stream of tokens, which is then decoded back into human-readable text.

## How tokens work in language models

The reason language models use tokens is tied to how they understand and predict language. Rather than processing characters or entire sentences directly, language models focus on **tokens**, which represent meaningful linguistic units. Here's how the process works:

1. **Input Tokenization**: When you provide a model with a prompt (e.g., "LangChain is cool!"), the tokenizer algorithm splits the text into tokens. For example, the sentence could be tokenized into parts like `["Lang", "Chain", " is", " cool", "!"]`. Note that token boundaries don’t always align with word boundaries.
 ![](/img/tokenization.png)

2. **Processing**: The transformer architecture behind these models processes tokens sequentially to predict the next token in a sentence. It does this by analyzing the relationships between tokens, capturing context and meaning from the input.
3. **Output Generation**: The model generates new tokens one by one. These output tokens are then decoded back into human-readable text.

Using tokens instead of raw characters allows the model to focus on linguistically meaningful units, which helps it capture grammar, structure, and context more effectively.

## Tokens don’t have to be text

Although tokens are most commonly used to represent text, they don’t have to be limited to textual data. Tokens can also serve as abstract representations of **multi-modal data**, such as:

- **Images**,
- **Audio**,
- **Video**,
- And other types of data.

At the time of writing, virtually no models support **multi-modal output**, and only a few models can handle **multi-modal inputs** (e.g., text combined with images or audio). However, as advancements in AI continue, we expect **multi-modality** to become much more common. This would allow models to process and generate a broader range of media, significantly expanding the scope of what tokens can represent and how models can interact with diverse types of data.

:::note
In principle, **anything that can be represented as a sequence of tokens** could be modeled in a similar way. For example, **DNA sequences**—which are composed of a series of nucleotides (A, T, C, G)—can be tokenized and modeled to capture patterns, make predictions, or generate sequences. This flexibility allows transformer-based models to handle diverse types of sequential data, further broadening their potential applications across various domains, including bioinformatics, signal processing, and other fields that involve structured or unstructured sequences.
:::

Please see the [multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality) section for more information on multi-modal inputs and outputs.

## Why not use characters?

Using tokens instead of individual characters makes models both more efficient and better at understanding context and grammar. Tokens represent meaningful units, like whole words or parts of words, allowing models to capture language structure more effectively than by processing raw characters. Token-level processing also reduces the number of units the model has to handle, leading to faster computation.

In contrast, character-level processing would require handling a much larger sequence of input, making it harder for the model to learn relationships and context. Tokens enable models to focus on linguistic meaning, making them more accurate and efficient in generating responses.

## How tokens correspond to text

Please see this post from [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them) for more details on how tokens are counted and how they correspond to text.

According to the OpenAI post, the approximate token counts for English text are as follows:

- 1 token ~= 4 chars in English
- 1 token ~= ¾ words
- 100 tokens ~= 75 words
```

# Tool calling

:::info[Prerequisites]

- [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)
- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

:::

## Overview

Many AI applications interact directly with humans. In these cases, it is appropriate for models to respond in natural language.
But what about cases where we want a model to also interact _directly_ with systems, such as databases or an API?
These systems often have a particular input schema; for example, APIs frequently have a required payload structure.
This need motivates the concept of _tool calling_. You can use [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/example-use-cases) to request model responses that match a particular schema.

:::info
You will sometimes hear the term `function calling`. We use this term interchangeably with `tool calling`.
:::

![Conceptual overview of tool calling](/img/tool_calling_concept.png)

## Key concepts

**(1) Tool Creation:** Use the [tool](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/_langchain_core.tools.tool-1.html) function to create a [tool](/docs/concepts/tools). A tool is an association between a function and its schema.
**(2) Tool Binding:** The tool needs to be connected to a model that supports tool calling. This gives the model awareness of the tool and the associated input schema required by the tool.
**(3) Tool Calling:** When appropriate, the model can decide to call a tool and ensure its response conforms to the tool's input schema.
**(4) Tool Execution:** The tool can be executed using the arguments provided by the model.

![Conceptual parts of tool calling](/img/tool_calling_components.png)

## Recommended usage

This pseudo-code illustrates the recommended workflow for using tool calling.
Created tools are passed to `.bindTools()` method as a list.
This model can be called, as usual. If a tool call is made, model's response will contain the tool call arguments.
The tool call arguments can be passed directly to the tool.

```typescript
// Tool creation
const tools = [myTool];
// Tool binding
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools(tools);
// Tool calling
const response = await modelWithTools.invoke(userInput);
```

## Tool creation

The recommended way to create a tool is using the `tool` function.

```typescript
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

const multiply = tool(
 ({ a, b }: { a: number; b: number }): number => {
 /**
 * Multiply a and b.
 */
 return a * b;
 },
 {
 name: "multiply",
 description: "Multiply two numbers",
 schema: z.object({
 a: z.number(),
 b: z.number(),
 }),
 }
);
```

:::info[Further reading]

- See our conceptual guide on [tools](/docs/concepts/tools/) for more details.
- See our [model integrations](/docs/integrations/chat/) that support tool calling.
- See our [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/tool_calling/) on tool calling.

:::

For tool calling that does not require a function to execute, you can also define just the tool schema:

```typescript
const multiplyTool = {
 name: "multiply",
 description: "Multiply two numbers",
 schema: z.object({
 a: z.number(),
 b: z.number(),
 }),
};
```

## Tool binding

[Many](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) [model providers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) support tool calling.

:::tip
See our [model integration page](/docs/integrations/chat/) for a list of providers that support tool calling.
:::

The central concept to understand is that LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting tools to models.
The `.bindTools()` method can be used to specify which tools are available for a model to call.

```typescript
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([toolsList]);
```

As a specific example, let's take a function `multiply` and bind it as a tool to a model that supports tool calling.

```typescript
const multiply = tool(
 ({ a, b }: { a: number; b: number }): number => {
 /**
 * Multiply a and b.
 *
 * @param a - first number
 * @param b - second number
 * @returns The product of a and b
 */
 return a * b;
 },
 {
 name: "multiply",
 description: "Multiply two numbers",
 schema: z.object({
 a: z.number(),
 b: z.number(),
 }),
 }
);

const llmWithTools = toolCallingModel.bindTools([multiply]);
```

## Tool calling

![Diagram of a tool call by a model](/img/tool_call_example.png)

A key principle of tool calling is that the model decides when to use a tool based on the input's relevance. The model doesn't always need to call a tool.
For example, given an unrelated input, the model would not call the tool:

```typescript
const result = await llmWithTools.invoke("Hello world!");
```

The result would be an `AIMessage` containing the model's response in natural language (e.g., "Hello!").
However, if we pass an input _relevant to the tool_, the model should choose to call it:

```typescript
const result = await llmWithTools.invoke("What is 2 multiplied by 3?");
```

As before, the output `result` will be an `AIMessage`.
But, if the tool was called, `result` will have a `tool_calls` attribute.
This attribute includes everything needed to execute the tool, including the tool name and input arguments:

```
result.tool_calls
{'name': 'multiply', 'args': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}, 'id': 'xxx', 'type': 'tool_call'}
```

For more details on usage, see our [how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#tools)!

## Tool execution

[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools/) implement the [Runnable](/docs/concepts/runnables/) interface, which means that they can be invoked (e.g., `tool.invoke(args)`) directly.

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) offers pre-built components (e.g., [`ToolNode`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph_prebuilt.ToolNode.html)) that will often invoke the tool in behalf of the user.

:::info[Further reading]

- See our [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/tool_calling/) on tool calling.
- See the [LangGraph documentation on using ToolNode](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/).

:::

## Best practices

When designing [tools](/docs/concepts/tools/) to be used by a model, it is important to keep in mind that:

- Models that have explicit [tool-calling APIs](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) will be better at tool calling than non-fine-tuned models.
- Models will perform better if the tools have well-chosen names and descriptions.
- Simple, narrowly scoped tools are easier for models to use than complex tools.
- Asking the model to select from a large list of tools poses challenges for the model.

# Tools

:::info Prerequisites

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/)

:::

## Overview

The **tool** abstraction in LangChain associates a TypeScript **function** with a **schema** that defines the function's **name**, **description** and **input**.

**Tools** can be passed to [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) that support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) allowing the model to request the execution of a specific function with specific inputs.

## Key concepts

- Tools are a way to encapsulate a function and its schema in a way that can be passed to a chat model.
- Create tools using the [tool](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/_langchain_core.tools.tool-1.html) function, which simplifies the process of tool creation, supporting the following:
 - Defining tools that return **artifacts** (e.g. images, etc.)
 - Hiding input arguments from the schema (and hence from the model) using **injected tool arguments**.

## Tool interface

The tool interface is defined in the [`StructuredTool`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.tools.StructuredTool.html) class which is a subclass of the [Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables).

The key attributes that correspond to the tool's **schema**:

- **name**: The name of the tool.
- **description**: A description of what the tool does.
- **args**: Property that returns the JSON schema for the tool's arguments.

The key methods to execute the function associated with the **tool**:

- **invoke**: Invokes the tool with the given arguments.

## Create tools using the `tool` function

The recommended way to create tools is using the [tool](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/_langchain_core.tools.tool-1.html) function. This function is designed to simplify the process of tool creation and should be used in most cases.

```typescript
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const multiply = tool(
 ({ a, b }: { a: number; b: number }): number => {
 /**
 * Multiply two numbers.
 */
 return a * b;
 },
 {
 name: "multiply",
 description: "Multiply two numbers",
 schema: z.object({
 a: z.number(),
 b: z.number(),
 }),
 }
);
```

For more details on how to create tools, see the [how to create custom tools](/docs/how_to/custom_tools/) guide.

:::note
LangChain has a few other ways to create tools; e.g., by sub-classing the [`StructuredTool`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.tools.StructuredTool.html) class or by using `StructuredTool`. These methods are shown in the [how to create custom tools guide](/docs/how_to/custom_tools/), but
we generally recommend using the `tool` function for most cases.
:::

## Use the tool directly

Once you have defined a tool, you can use it directly by calling the function. For example, to use the `multiply` tool defined above:

```typescript
await multiply.invoke({ a: 2, b: 3 });
```

### Inspect

You can also inspect the tool's schema and other properties:

```typescript
console.log(multiply.name); // multiply
console.log(multiply.description); // Multiply two numbers.
```

:::note
If you're using pre-built LangChain or LangGraph components like [createReactAgent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph_prebuilt.createReactAgent.html),you might not need to interact with tools directly. However, understanding how to use them can be valuable for debugging and testing. Additionally, when building custom LangGraph workflows, you may find it necessary to work with tools directly.
:::

## Configuring the schema

The `tool` function offers additional options to configure the schema of the tool (e.g., modify name, description
or parse the function's doc-string to infer the schema).

Please see the [API reference for tool](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/_langchain_core.tools.tool-1.html) for more details and review the [how to create custom tools](/docs/how_to/custom_tools/) guide for examples.

## Tool artifacts

**Tools** are utilities that can be called by a model, and whose outputs are designed to be fed back to a model. Sometimes, however, there are artifacts of a tool's execution that we want to make accessible to downstream components in our chain or agent, but that we don't want to expose to the model itself. For example if a tool returns a custom object, a dataframe or an image, we may want to pass some metadata about this output to the model without passing the actual output to the model. At the same time, we may want to be able to access this full output elsewhere, for example in downstream tools.

```typescript
const someTool = tool(({ ... }) => {
 // do something
}, {
 // ... tool schema args
 // Set the returnType to "content_and_artifact"
 responseFormat: "content_and_artifact"
});
```

See [how to return artifacts from tools](/docs/how_to/tool_artifacts/) for more details.

### RunnableConfig

You can use the `RunnableConfig` object to pass custom run time values to tools.

If you need to access the [RunnableConfig](/docs/concepts/runnables/#RunnableConfig) object from within a tool. This can be done by using the `RunnableConfig` in the tool's function signature.

```typescript
import { RunnableConfig } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const someTool = tool(
 async (args: any, config: RunnableConfig): Promise<[string, any]> => {
 /**
 * Tool that does something.
 */
 },
 {
 name: "some_tool",
 description: "Tool that does something",
 schema: z.object({ ... }),
 returnType: "content_and_artifact"
 }
);

await someTool.invoke(..., { configurable: { value: "some_value" } });
```

The `config` will not be part of the tool's schema and will be injected at runtime with appropriate values.

## Best practices

When designing tools to be used by models, keep the following in mind:

- Tools that are well-named, correctly-documented and properly type-hinted are easier for models to use.
- Design simple and narrowly scoped tools, as they are easier for models to use correctly.
- Use chat models that support [tool-calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) APIs to take advantage of tools.

## Toolkits

<span data-heading-keywords="toolkit,toolkits"></span>

LangChain has a concept of **toolkits**. This a very thin abstraction that groups tools together that
are designed to be used together for specific tasks.

### Interface

All Toolkits expose a `getTools` method which returns a list of tools. You can therefore do:

```typescript
// Initialize a toolkit
const toolkit = new ExampleTookit(...)

// Get list of tools
const tools = toolkit.getTools()
```

# Tracing

<span data-heading-keywords="trace,tracing"></span>

A trace is essentially a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output.
Traces contain individual steps called `runs`. These can be individual calls from a model, retriever,
tool, or sub-chains.
Tracing gives you observability inside your chains and agents, and is vital in diagnosing issues.

# Vector stores

:::info[Prerequisites]

- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/)
- [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters/)

:::
:::info[Note]

This conceptual overview focuses on text-based indexing and retrieval for simplicity.
However, embedding models can be [multi-modal](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings)
and vector stores can be used to store and retrieve a variety of data types beyond text.
:::

## Overview

Vector stores are specialized data stores that enable indexing and retrieving information based on vector representations.

These vectors, called [embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/), capture the semantic meaning of data that has been embedded.

Vector stores are frequently used to search over unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, to retrieve relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.

![Vector stores](/img/vectorstores.png)

## Integrations

LangChain has a large number of vectorstore integrations, allowing users to easily switch between different vectorstore implementations.

Please see the [full list of LangChain vectorstore integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/).

## Interface

LangChain provides a standard interface for working with vector stores, allowing users to easily switch between different vectorstore implementations.

The interface consists of basic methods for writing, deleting and searching for documents in the vector store.

The key methods are:

- `addDocuments`: Add a list of texts to the vector store.
- `deleteDocuments` / `delete`: Delete a list of documents from the vector store.
- `similaritySearch`: Search for similar documents to a given query.

## Initialization

Most vectors in LangChain accept an embedding model as an argument when initializing the vector store.

We will use LangChain's [MemoryVectorStore](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.vectorstores_memory.MemoryVectorStore.html) implementation to illustrate the API.

```typescript
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
// Initialize with an embedding model
const vectorStore = new MemoryVectorStore(new SomeEmbeddingModel());
```

## Adding documents

To add documents, use the `addDocuments` method.

This API works with a list of [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects.
`Document` objects all have `pageContent` and `metadata` attributes, making them a universal way to store unstructured text and associated metadata.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const document1 = new Document(
 pageContent: "I had chocalate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.",
 metadata: { source: "tweet" },
)

const document2 = new Document(
 pageContent: "The weather forecast for tomorrow is cloudy and overcast, with a high of 62 degrees.",
 metadata: { source: "news" },
)

const documents = [document1, document2]

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents)
```

You should usually provide IDs for the documents you add to the vector store, so
that instead of adding the same document multiple times, you can update the existing document.

```typescript
await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { ids: ["doc1", "doc2"] });
```

## Delete

To delete documents, use the `deleteDocuments` method which takes a list of document IDs to delete.

```typescript
await vectorStore.deleteDocuments(["doc1"]);
```

or the `delete` method:

```typescript
await vectorStore.deleteDocuments({ ids: ["doc1"] });
```

## Search

Vector stores embed and store the documents that added.
If we pass in a query, the vectorstore will embed the query, perform a similarity search over the embedded documents, and return the most similar ones.
This captures two important concepts: first, there needs to be a way to measure the similarity between the query and _any_ [embedded](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/) document.
Second, there needs to be an algorithm to efficiently perform this similarity search across _all_ embedded documents.

### Similarity metrics

A critical advantage of embeddings vectors is they can be compared using many simple mathematical operations:

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points.
- **Dot Product**: Measures the projection of one vector onto another.

The choice of similarity metric can sometimes be selected when initializing the vectorstore. Please refer
to the documentation of the specific vectorstore you are using to see what similarity metrics are supported.

:::info[Further reading]

- See [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/dnn-clustering/supervised-similarity) from Google on similarity metrics to consider with embeddings.
- See Pinecone's [blog post](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-similarity/) on similarity metrics.
- See OpenAI's [FAQ](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/faq) on what similarity metric to use with OpenAI embeddings.

:::

### Similarity search

Given a similarity metric to measure the distance between the embedded query and any embedded document, we need an algorithm to efficiently search over _all_ the embedded documents to find the most similar ones.
There are various ways to do this. As an example, many vectorstores implement [HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/), a graph-based index structure that allows for efficient similarity search.
Regardless of the search algorithm used under the hood, the LangChain vectorstore interface has a `similaritySearch` method for all integrations.
This will take the search query, create an embedding, find similar documents, and return them as a list of [Documents](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html).

```typescript
const query = "my query";
const docs = await vectorstore.similaritySearch(query);
```

Many vectorstores support search parameters to be passed with the `similaritySearch` method. See the documentation for the specific vectorstore you are using to see what parameters are supported.
As an example [Pinecone](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_pinecone.PineconeStore.html#similaritySearch) several parameters that are important general concepts:
Many vectorstores support [the `k`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone/#query-directly), which controls the number of Documents to return, and `filter`, which allows for filtering documents by metadata.

- `query (string) – Text to look up documents similar to.`
- `k (number) – Number of Documents to return. Defaults to 4.`
- `filter (Record<string, any> | undefined) – Object of argument(s) to filter on metadata`

:::info[Further reading]

- See the [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/vectorstores/) for more details on how to use the `similaritySearch` method.
- See the [integrations page](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) for more details on arguments that can be passed in to the `similaritySearch` method for specific vectorstores.

:::

### Metadata filtering

While vectorstore implement a search algorithm to efficiently search over _all_ the embedded documents to find the most similar ones, many also support filtering on metadata.
This allows structured filters to reduce the size of the similarity search space. These two concepts work well together:

1. **Semantic search**: Query the unstructured data directly, often using via embedding or keyword similarity.
2. **Metadata search**: Apply structured query to the metadata, filtering specific documents.

Vector store support for metadata filtering is typically dependent on the underlying vector store implementation.

Here is example usage with [Pinecone](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone/#query-directly), showing that we filter for all documents that have the metadata key `source` with value `tweet`.

```typescript
await vectorstore.similaritySearch(
 "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy",
 2,
 {
 // The arguments of this field are provider specific.
 filter: { source: "tweet" },
 }
);
```

:::info[Further reading]

- See Pinecone's [documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/filter-with-metadata) on filtering with metadata.
- See the [list of LangChain vectorstore integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/) that support metadata filtering.

:::

## Advanced search and retrieval techniques

While algorithms like HNSW provide the foundation for efficient similarity search in many cases, additional techniques can be employed to improve search quality and diversity.
For example, maximal marginal relevance is a re-ranking algorithm used to diversify search results, which is applied after the initial similarity search to ensure a more diverse set of results.

| Name | When to use | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone/#maximal-marginal-relevance-searches) | When needing to diversify search results. | MMR attempts to diversify the results of a search to avoid returning similar and redundant documents. |

# Why LangChain?

The goal of the `langchain` package and LangChain the company is to make it as easy possible for developers to build applications that reason.
While LangChain originally started as a single open source package, it has evolved into a company and a whole ecosystem.
This page will talk about the LangChain ecosystem as a whole.
Most of the components within in the LangChain ecosystem can be used by themselves - so if you feel particularly drawn to certain components but not others, that is totally fine! Pick and choose whichever components you like best.

## Features

There are several primary needs that LangChain aims to address:

1. **Standardized component interfaces:** The growing number of [models](/docs/integrations/chat/) and [related components](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) for AI applications has resulted in a wide variety of different APIs that developers need to learn and use.
 This diversity can make it challenging for developers to switch between providers or combine components when building applications.
 LangChain exposes a standard interface for key components, making it easy to switch between providers.

2. **Orchestration:** As applications become more complex, combining multiple components and models, there's [a growing need to efficiently connect these elements into control flows](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) that can [accomplish diverse tasks](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/).
 [Orchestration](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)>) is crucial for building such applications.

3. **Observability and evaluation:** As applications become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand what is happening within them.
 Furthermore, the pace of development can become rate-limited by the [paradox of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_choice):
 for example, developers often wonder how to engineer their prompt or which LLM best balances accuracy, latency, and cost.
 [Observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) and evaluations can help developers monitor their applications and rapidly answer these types of questions with confidence.

## Standardized component interfaces

LangChain provides common interfaces for components that are central to many AI applications.
As an example, all [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) implement the [BaseChatModel](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html) interface.
This provides a standard way to interact with chat models, supporting important but often provider-specific features like [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) and [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/).

### Example: chat models

Many [model providers](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/), a critical features for many applications (e.g., [agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/agentic_concepts/)), that allows a developer to request model responses that match a particular schema.
The APIs for each provider differ.
LangChain's [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) interface provides a common way to bind [tools](/docs/concepts/tools) to a model in order to support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/):

```typescript
// Tool creation
const tools = [myTool];
// Tool binding
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools(tools);
```

Similarly, getting models to produce [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/) is an extremely common use case.
Providers support different approaches for this, including [JSON mode or tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs), with different APIs.
LangChain's [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) interface provides a common way to produce structured outputs using the `withStructuredOutput()` method:

```typescript
// Define tool as a Zod schema
const schema = z.object({ ... });
// Bind schema to model
const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(schema)
```

### Example: retrievers

In the context of [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag/) and LLM application components, LangChain's [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) interface provides a standard way to connect to many different types of data services or databases (e.g., [vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) or databases).
The underlying implementation of the retriever depends on the type of data store or database you are connecting to, but all retrievers implement the [runnable interface](/docs/concepts/runnables/), meaning they can be invoked in a common manner.

```typescript
const documents = await myRetriever.invoke("What is the meaning of life?");
```

```text
[
 Document({
 pageContent: "The meaning of life is 42.",
 metadata: { ... },
 }),
 Document({
 pageContent: "The meaning of life is to use LangChain.",
 metadata: { ... },
 }),
 ...
]
```

## Orchestration

While standardization for individual components is useful, we've increasingly seen that developers want to _combine_ components into more complex applications.
This motivates the need for [orchestration](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)>).
There are several common characteristics of LLM applications that this orchestration layer should support:

- **Complex control flow:** The application requires complex patterns such as cycles (e.g., a loop that reiterates until a condition is met).
- **[Persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/persistence/):** The application needs to maintain [short-term and / or long-term memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/).
- **[Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/human_in_the_loop/):** The application needs human interaction, e.g., pausing, reviewing, editing, approving certain steps.

The recommended way to do orchestration for these complex applications is [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/high_level/).
LangGraph is a library that gives developers a high degree of control by expressing the flow of the application as a set of nodes and edges.
LangGraph comes with built-in support for [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/persistence/), [human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/human_in_the_loop/), [memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/), and other features.
It's particularly well suited for building [agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/agentic_concepts/) or [multi-agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/multi_agent/) applications.
Importantly, individual LangChain components can be used within LangGraph nodes, but you can also use LangGraph **without** using LangChain components.

## Observability and evaluation

The pace of AI application development is often rate-limited by high-quality evaluations because there is a paradox of choice.
Developers often wonder how to engineer their prompt or which LLM best balances accuracy, latency, and cost.
High quality tracing and evaluations can help you rapidly answer these types of questions with confidence.
[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) is our platform that supports observability and evaluation for AI applications.
See our conceptual guides on [evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/evaluation) and [tracing](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/tracing) for more details.

:::info[Further reading]

## Conclusion

LangChain offers standard interfaces for components that are central to many AI applications, which offers a few specific advantages:

- **Ease of swapping providers:** It allows you to swap out different component providers without having to change the underlying code.
- **Advanced features:** It provides common methods for more advanced features, such as [streaming](/docs/concepts/runnables/#streaming) and [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/).

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/high_level/) makes it possible to orchestrate complex applications (e.g., [agents](/docs/concepts/agents/)) and provide features like including [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/persistence/), [human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/human_in_the_loop/), or [memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/).

[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) makes it possible to iterate with confidence on your applications, by providing LLM-specific observability and framework for testing and evaluating your application.

To contribute to this project, please follow the ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.

Please follow the checked-in pull request template when opening pull requests. Note related issues and tag relevant
maintainers.

Pull requests cannot land without passing the formatting, linting, and testing checks first. See [Testing](#testing) and
[Formatting and Linting](#formatting-and-linting) for how to run these checks locally.

It's essential that we maintain great documentation and testing. If you:

- Fix a bug
 - Add a relevant unit or integration test when possible. These live in `**/tests/*.test.ts` and `**/tests/*.int.test.ts/`.
- Make an improvement
 - Update any affected example notebooks and documentation. These live in `docs`.
 - Update unit and integration tests when relevant.
- Add a feature
 - Add a demo notebook/MDX file in `docs/core_docs/docs`.
 - Add unit and integration tests.

We are a small, progress-oriented team. If there's something you'd like to add or change, opening a pull request is the
best way to get our attention.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This quick start guide explains how to run the repository locally.
For a [development container](https://containers.dev/), see the [.devcontainer folder](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/main/.devcontainer).

### 🏭 Release process

As of now, LangChain has an ad hoc release process: releases are cut with high frequency by
a developer and published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langchain).

LangChain follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning standard. However, as pre-1.0 software,
even patch releases may contain [non-backwards-compatible changes](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

If your contribution has made its way into a release, we will want to give you credit on Twitter (only if you want though)!
If you have a Twitter account you would like us to mention, please let us know in the PR or in another manner.

#### Integration releases

The release script can be executed only while on a fresh `main` branch, with no un-committed changes, from the package root. If working from a fork of the repository, make sure to sync the forked `main` branch with the upstream `main` branch first.

You can invoke the script by calling `yarn release`. If new dependencies have been added to the integration package, install them first (i.e. run `yarn`, then `yarn release`).

There are three parameters which can be passed to this script, one required and two optional.

- **Required**: `<workspace name>`. eg: `@langchain/core` The name of the package to release. Can be found in the `name` value of the package's `package.json`
- **Optional**: `--bump-deps` eg `--bump-deps` Will find all packages in the repo which depend on this workspace and checkout a new branch, update the dep version, run yarn install, commit & push to new branch. Generally, this is not necessary.
- **Optional**: `--tag <tag>` eg `--tag beta` Add a tag to the NPM release. Useful if you want to push a release candidate.

This script automatically bumps the package version, creates a new release branch with the changes, pushes the branch to GitHub, uses `release-it` to automatically release to NPM, and more depending on the flags passed.

Halfway through this script, you'll be prompted to enter an NPM OTP (typically from an authenticator app). This value is not stored anywhere and is only used to authenticate the NPM release.

> **Note** Unless releasing `langchain`, `no` should be answered to all prompts following `Publish @langchain/<package> to npm?`. Then, the change should be manually committed with the following commit message: `<package>[patch]: Release <new version>`. E.g.: `groq[patch]: Release 0.0.1`.

Docker must be running if releasing one of `langchain`, `@langchain/core` or `@langchain/community`. These packages run LangChain's export tests, which run inside docker containers.

Full example: `yarn release @langchain/core`.

### 🛠️ Tooling

This project uses the following tools, which are worth getting familiar
with if you plan to contribute:

- **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v3.4.1)** - dependency management
- **[eslint](https://eslint.org/)** - enforcing standard lint rules
- **[prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - enforcing standard code formatting
- **[jest](https://jestjs.io/)** - testing code
- **[TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/)** - reference doc generation from
 comments
- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** - static site generation for documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone this repo, then cd into it:

```bash
cd langchainjs
```

Next, try running the following common tasks:

## ✅ Common Tasks

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute to this project.
All of the below commands should be run from within a workspace directory (e.g. `langchain`, `libs/langchain-community`) unless otherwise noted.

```bash
cd langchain
```

Or, if you are working on a community integration:

```bash
cd libs/langchain-community
```

### Setup

**Prerequisite**: Node version 18+ is required. Please check node version `node -v` and update it if required.

To get started, you will need to install the dependencies for the project. To do so, run:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, you will need to switch directories into `langchain-core` and build core by running:

```bash
cd ../langchain-core
yarn
yarn build
```

### Linting

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce standard lint rules.
To run the linter, run:

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io) to enforce code formatting style.
To run the formatter, run:

```bash
yarn format
```

To just check for formatting differences, without fixing them, run:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

### Testing

In general, tests should be added within a `tests/` folder alongside the modules they
are testing.

**Unit tests** cover modular logic that does not require calls to outside APIs.

If you add new logic, please add a unit test.
Unit tests should be called `*.test.ts`.

To run only unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

#### Running a single test

To run a single test, run the following from within a workspace:

```bash
yarn test:single /path/to/yourtest.test.ts
```

This is useful for developing individual features.

**Integration tests** cover logic that requires making calls to outside APIs (often integration with other services).

If you add support for a new external API, please add a new integration test.
Integration tests should be called `*.int.test.ts`.

Note that most integration tests require credentials or other setup. You will likely need to set up a `langchain/.env` or `libs/langchain-community/.env` file
like the example [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/langchain/.env.example).

We generally recommend only running integration tests with `yarn test:single`, but if you want to run all integration tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

### Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Adding an Entrypoint

LangChain exposes multiple subpaths the user can import from, e.g.

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
```

We call these subpaths "entrypoints". In general, you should create a new entrypoint if you are adding a new integration with a 3rd party library. If you're adding self-contained functionality without any external dependencies, you can add it to an existing entrypoint.

In order to declare a new entrypoint that users can import from, you
should edit the `langchain/langchain.config.js` or `libs/langchain-community/langchain.config.js` file. To add an
entrypoint `tools` that imports from `tools/index.ts` you'd add
the following to the `entrypoints` key inside the `config` variable:

```typescript
// ...
entrypoints: {
 // ...
 tools: "tools/index",
},
// ...
```

If you're adding a new integration which requires installing a third party dependency, you must add the entrypoint to the `requiresOptionalDependency` array, also located inside `langchain/langchain.config.js` or `libs/langchain-community/langchain.config.js`.

```typescript
// ...
requiresOptionalDependency: [
 // ...
 "tools/index",
],
// ...
```

This will make sure the entrypoint is included in the published package,
and in generated documentation.

## Documentation

### Contribute Documentation

#### Install dependencies

##### Note: you only need to follow these steps if you are building the docs site locally.

1. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) - package that converts Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) into `.mdx` files for serving in Docusaurus.
2. `yarn build --filter=core_docs` - It's as simple as that! (or you can simply run `yarn build` from `docs/core_docs/`)

All notebooks are converted to `.md` files and automatically gitignored. If you would like to create a non notebook doc, it must be a `.mdx` file.

### Writing Notebooks

When adding new dependencies inside the notebook you must update the import map inside `deno.json` in the root of the LangChain repo.

This is required because the notebooks use the Deno runtime, and Deno formats imports differently than Node.js.

Example:

```typescript
// Import in Node:
import { z } from "zod";
// Import in Deno:
import { z } from "npm:/zod";
```

See examples inside `deno.json` for more details.

Docs are largely autogenerated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) from the code.

For that reason, we ask that you add good documentation to all classes and methods.

Similar to linting, we recognize documentation can be annoying. If you do not want to do it, please contact a project maintainer, and they can help you with it. We do not want this to be a blocker for good code getting contributed.

Documentation and the skeleton lives under the `docs/` folder. Example code is imported from under the `examples/` folder.

### Running examples

If you add a new major piece of functionality, it is helpful to add an
example to showcase how to use it. Most of our users find examples to be the
most helpful kind of documentation.

Examples can be added in the `examples/src` directory, e.g.
`examples/src/path/to/example`. This
example can then be invoked with `yarn example path/to/example` at the top
level of the repo.

To run examples that require an environment variable, you'll need to add a `.env` file under `examples/.env`.

### Build Documentation Locally

To generate and view the documentation locally, change to the project root and run `yarn` to ensure dependencies get installed
in both the `docs/` and `examples/` workspaces:

```bash
cd ..
yarn
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn docs
```

## Advanced

**Environment tests** test whether LangChain works across different JS environments, including Node.js (both ESM and CJS), Edge environments (eg. Cloudflare Workers), and browsers (using Webpack).

To run the environment tests with Docker, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
yarn test:exports:docker
```
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Pull Requests (PRs)

### How do I allow maintainers to edit my PR?

When you submit a pull request, there may be additional changes
necessary before merging it. Oftentimes, it is more efficient for the
maintainers to make these changes themselves before merging, rather than asking you
to do so in code review.

By default, most pull requests will have a
`✅ Maintainers are allowed to edit this pull request.`
badge in the right-hand sidebar.

If you do not see this badge, you may have this setting off for the fork you are
pull-requesting from. See [this Github docs page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
for more information.

Notably, Github doesn't allow this setting to be enabled for forks in **organizations** ([issue](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/5634)).
If you are working in an organization, we recommend submitting your PR from a personal
fork in order to enable this setting.

There is a taxonomy of labels to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help organize issues.

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.
If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up-to-date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of development in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.

### 💭 GitHub Discussions

We have a [discussions](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/discussions) page where users can ask usage questions, discuss design decisions, and propose new features.

If you are able to help answer questions, please do so! This will allow the maintainers to spend more time focused on development and bug fixing.

### 🙋 Getting Help

Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, please
contact a maintainer! Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we also want to make sure that the process is
smooth for future contributors.

In a similar vein, we do enforce certain linting, formatting, and documentation standards in the codebase.
If you are finding these difficult (or even just annoying) to work with, feel free to contact a maintainer for help -
we do not want these to get in the way of getting good code into the codebase.

# 🌟 Recognition

If your contribution has made its way into a release, we will want to give you credit on Twitter (only if you want though)!

# Contribute Integrations

To begin, make sure you have all the dependencies outlined in guide on [Contributing Code](/docs/contributing/code/).

There are a few different places you can contribute integrations for LangChain:

- **Community**: For lighter-weight integrations that are primarily maintained by LangChain and the Open Source Community.
- **Partner Packages**: For independent packages that are co-maintained by LangChain and a partner.

For the most part, new integrations should be added to the Community package. Partner packages require more maintenance as separate packages, so please confirm with the LangChain team before creating a new partner package.

In the following sections, we'll walk through how to contribute to each of these packages from a fake company, `Parrot Link AI`.

## Community package

The `@langchain/community` package is in `libs/langchain-community` and contains most integrations.

It can be installed with e.g. `npm install @langchain/community`, and exported members can be imported with code like

```ts
import { ChatParrotLink } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/parrot_link";
import { ParrotLinkLLM } from "@langchain/community/llms/parrot_link";
import { ParrotLinkVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/parrot_link";
```

The `@langchain/community` package relies on manually-installed dependent packages, so you will see errors
if you try to import a package that is not installed. In our fake example, if you tried to import `ParrotLinkLLM` without installing `parrot-link-sdk`, you would see an error telling you that the package failed to import.

Let's say we wanted to implement a chat model for Parrot Link AI. We would create a new file in `libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/parrot_link.ts` with something like the following code:

```ts
import {
 SimpleChatModel,
} from "@langchain/core/language_models/chat_models";

export class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel {

 ...
```

Tests are colocated in the `src/` directory, so you could write them in files like the below:

- Unit tests: `libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/tests/parrot_link.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/tests/parrot_link.int.test.ts`

Unit tests should not have any external API calls or require any environment variables.

You should add documentation to:

- `docs/core_docs/docs/integrations/chat/parrot_link.mdx`

## Partner package in LangChain repo

Partner packages can be hosted in the `LangChain` monorepo.

Partner packages in the `LangChain` repo should be placed under `libs/langchain-{partner}`

A package is
installed by users with `npm install @langchain/{partner}`, and the package members
can be imported with code like:

```ts
import { X } from "@langchain/{partner}";
```

### Set up a new package

To set up a new partner package, you can use [`create-langchain-integration`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/libs/create-langchain-integration/),
a utility that will automatically scaffold a repo with support for both ESM + CJS entrypoints. You can run it like this within the `libs/` folder:

```bash
cd libs/
npx create-langchain-integration
```

Then, follow the prompts to name your package.
The default package will include stubs for a Chat Model, an LLM, and/or a Vector Store. You should delete any of the files you won't use and remove them from `index.ts`.

### Dependencies

If your package needs dependencies, such as your company's SDK, you can add them to your package's `package.json` file as normal:

```bash
npm install parrot-link-sdk
```

### Write Unit and Integration Tests

Some basic tests are presented in the `src/tests/` directory. You should add more tests to cover your package's functionality.

For information on running and implementing tests, see the [Testing guide](/docs/contributing/testing/).

### Write documentation

Please copy and use the appropriate template from here:

https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/main/libs/langchain-scripts/src/cli/docs/templates

You should place the notebooks with examples
in the relevant `docs/core_docs/docs/integrations` directory in the monorepo root.

### (If Necessary) Deprecate community integration

Note: this is only necessary if you're migrating an existing community integration into
a partner package. If the component you're integrating is net-new to LangChain (i.e.
not already in the `community` package), you can skip this step.

Let's pretend we migrated our `ChatParrotLink` chat model from the community package to
the partner package. We would need to deprecate the old model in the community package.
We can do this using a `@deprecated` TSDoc comment.

Before our change, our chat model might look like this:

```ts
class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel {
 ...
```

After our change, it would look like this:

```ts
/** @deprecated Install and import from `@langchain/parrot-link` instead. */
class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel {
 ...
```

You should do this for _each_ component that you're migrating to the partner package.
```

# Repository Structure

If you plan on contributing to LangChain code or documentation, it can be useful
to understand the high level structure of the repository.

LangChain is organized as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains multiple packages.

Here's the structure visualized as a tree:

```text
.
├── docs
│ ├── core_docs # Contains content for the documentation here: https://js.langchain.com/
│ ├── api_refs # Contains content for the API refs here: https://api.js.langchain.com/
├── langchain # Main package
│ ├── src/**/tests/*.test.ts/ # Unit tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
│ ├── src/**/tests/*.int.test.ts/ # Integration tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
├── langchain # Base interfaces for key abstractions
├── libs # Community packages
│ ├── langchain-community # Third-party integrations
│ ├── langchain-partner-1
│ ├── langchain-partner-2
│ ├── ...
```

The root directory also contains the following files:

- `package.json`: Dependencies for building docs and linting docs.

There are other files in the root directory level, but their presence should be self-explanatory. Feel free to browse around!

## Documentation

The `/docs` directory contains the content for the documentation that is shown
at https://js.langchain.com/ and the associated API Reference https://api.js.langchain.com/

See the [documentation](/docs/contributing/documentation/style_guide) guidelines to learn how to contribute to the documentation.

## Code

The `/libs` directory contains the code for the LangChain packages.

To learn more about how to contribute code see the following guidelines:

- [Code](./code.mdx) Learn how to develop in the LangChain codebase.
- [Integrations](./integrations.mdx) to learn how to contribute to third-party integrations to langchain-community or to start a new partner package.
- [Testing](./testing.mdx) guidelines to learn how to write tests for the packages.

# Testing

In general, tests should be added within a `tests/` folder alongside the modules they
are testing.

**Unit tests** cover modular logic that does not require calls to outside APIs.

If you add new logic, please add a unit test.
Unit tests should be called `*.test.ts`.

To run only unit tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Running a single test

To run a single test, run the following from within a workspace:

```bash
yarn test:single /path/to/yourtest.test.ts
```

This is useful for developing individual features.

**Integration tests** cover logic that requires making calls to outside APIs (often integration with other services).

If you add support for a new external API, please add a new integration test.
Integration tests should be called `*.int.test.ts`.

Note that most integration tests require credentials or other setup. You will likely need to set up a `langchain/.env` or `libs/langchain-community/.env` file
like the example [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/langchain/.env.example).

We generally recommend only running integration tests with `yarn test:single`, but if you want to run all integration tests, run:

```bash
yarn test:integration
```
```

# LangChain Documentation Style Guide

## Introduction

As LangChain continues to grow, the surface area of documentation required to cover it continues to grow too.
This page provides guidelines for anyone writing documentation for LangChain, as well as some of our philosophies around
organization and structure.

## Philosophy

LangChain's documentation aspires to follow the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr).
Under this framework, all documentation falls under one of four categories:

- **Tutorials**: Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of conceptual steps to complete a project.
 - An example of this is our [LCEL streaming guide](/docs/how_to/streaming).
 - Our guides on [custom components](/docs/how_to/custom_chat) is another one.
- **How-to guides**: Guides that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.
 - The clearest examples of this are our [Use case](/docs/how_to/#use-cases) pages.
- **Reference**: Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
 - Our [Runnable](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) pages is an example of this.
 - The [API reference pages](https://api.js.langchain.com/) are another.
- **Explanation**: Explanations that clarify and illuminate a particular topic.

Each category serves a distinct purpose and requires a specific approach to writing and structuring the content.

## Taxonomy

Keeping the above in mind, we have sorted LangChain's docs into categories. It is helpful to think in these terms
when contributing new documentation:

### Getting started

The [getting started section](/docs/introduction) includes a high-level introduction to LangChain, a quickstart that
tours LangChain's various features, and logistical instructions around installation and project setup.

It contains elements of **How-to guides** and **Explanations**.

### Use cases

[Use cases](/docs/how_to/#use-cases) are guides that are meant to show how to use LangChain to accomplish a specific task (RAG, information extraction, etc.).
The quickstarts should be good entrypoints for first-time LangChain developers who prefer to learn by getting something practical prototyped,
then taking the pieces apart retrospectively. These should mirror what LangChain is good at.

The quickstart pages here should fit the **How-to guide** category, with the other pages intended to be **Explanations** of more
in-depth concepts and strategies that accompany the main happy paths.

:::note
The below sections are listed roughly in order of increasing level of abstraction.
:::

### Expression Language

[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel) is the fundamental way that most LangChain components fit together, and this section is designed to teach
developers how to use it to build with LangChain's primitives effectively.

This section should contains **Tutorials** that teach how to stream and use LCEL primitives for more abstract tasks, **Explanations** of specific behaviors,
and some **References** for how to use different methods in the Runnable interface.

### Components

The [how to section](/docs/how_to) covers concepts one level of abstraction higher than LCEL.
Abstract base classes like `BaseChatModel` and `BaseRetriever` should be covered here, as well as core implementations of these base classes,
such as `ChatPromptTemplate` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Customization guides belong here too.

This section should contain mostly conceptual **Tutorials**, **References**, and **Explanations** of the components they cover.

:::note
As a general rule of thumb, everything covered in the `Expression Language` and `Components` sections (with the exception of the `Composition` section of components) should
cover only components that exist in `@langchain/core`.
:::

### Integrations

The [integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/) are specific implementations of components. These often involve third-party APIs and services.
If this is the case, as a general rule, these are maintained by the third-party partner.

This section should contain mostly **Explanations** and **References**, though the actual content here is more flexible than other sections and more at the
discretion of the third-party provider.

:::note
Concepts covered in `Integrations` should generally exist in `@langchain/community` or specific partner packages.
:::

### Tutorials and Ecosystem

The [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and [Ecosystem](https://docs.smith.langchain.com) sections should contain guides that address higher-level problems than the sections above.
This includes, but is not limited to, considerations around productionization and development workflows.

These should contain mostly **How-to guides**, **Explanations**, and **Tutorials**.

### API references

LangChain's API references. Should act as **References** (as the name implies) with some **Explanation**-focused content as well.

## Sample developer journey

We have set up our docs to assist a new developer to LangChain. Let's walk through the intended path:

- The developer lands on https://js.langchain.com, and reads through the introduction and the diagram.
- If they are just curious, they may be drawn to the [Quickstart](/docs/tutorials/llm_chain) to get a high-level tour of what LangChain contains.
- If they have a specific task in mind that they want to accomplish, they will be drawn to the Use-Case section. The use-case should provide a good, concrete hook that shows the value LangChain can provide them and be a good entrypoint to the framework.
- They can then move to learn more about the fundamentals of LangChain through the Expression Language sections.
- Next, they can learn about LangChain's various components and integrations.
- Finally, they can get additional knowledge through the Guides.

This is only an ideal of course - sections will inevitably reference lower or higher-level concepts that are documented in other sections.

## Guidelines

Here are some other guidelines you should think about when writing and organizing documentation.

### Linking to other sections

Because sections of the docs do not exist in a vacuum, it is important to link to other sections as often as possible
to allow a developer to learn more about an unfamiliar topic inline.

This includes linking to the API references as well as conceptual sections!

### Conciseness

In general, take a less-is-more approach. If a section with a good explanation of a concept already exists, you should link to it rather than
re-explain it, unless the concept you are documenting presents some new wrinkle.

Be concise, including in code samples.

### General style

- Use active voice and present tense whenever possible.
- Use examples and code snippets to illustrate concepts and usage.
- Use appropriate header levels (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to organize the content hierarchically.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break down information into easily digestible chunks.
- Use tables (especially for **Reference** sections) and diagrams often to present information visually.
- Include the table of contents for longer documentation pages to help readers navigate the content, but hide it for shorter pages.

# LangChain.js cookbook

Example code for building applications with LangChain.js, with an emphasis on more applied and end-to-end examples than contained in the [main documentation](https://js.langchain.com).

## Setup

These cookbooks are in Jupyter notebook form and use the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com) and the experimental [Deno Jupyter Kernel](https://deno.com/blog/v1.37) (requires >= Deno v1.37).

Full installation instructions are available here: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/jupyter

Note that you will also need to install the Python `jupyter` package, and that the syntax for imports and environment variables are slightly different from Node and the web. In particular, we use `Deno.env.get()` to retrieve environment variables, and e.g. `import { PromptTemplate } from "https://esm.sh/langchain/prompts";` to import from a URL to match Deno conventions.

Notebook | Description
:- | :-
[rewrite.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/master/cookbook/rewrite.ipynb) | Handle real-world questions that contain extraneous, distracting information in your RAG chains by first rewriting them before performing retrieval.
[rag_fusion.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/master/cookbook/rag_fusion.ipynb) | Turn user queries into more search friendly queries, then query a vector store and use reciprocal rank fusion to rank the results.
[basic_critique_revise.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/master/cookbook/basic_critique_revise.ipynb) | Basic example of correcting an LLM's output using a pattern called critique-revise, where we highlight what part of the output is wrong and re-query the LLM for a correction.
[step_back.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/master/cookbook/step_back.ipynb) | Example of a step back prompting technique, where we ask the LLM to take a step back and rephrase the original query for a more search friendly question.

 "This section will cover building with LangChain Agents. LangChain Agents are fine for getting started, but past a certain point you will likely want flexibility and control that they do not offer. For working with more advanced agents, we'd recommend checking out [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs).\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "## Concepts\n",
 "\n",
 "Concepts we will cover are:\n",
 "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models), in particular their tool calling ability\n",
 "- Creating a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers) to expose specific information to our agent\n",
 "- Using a Search [Tool](/docs/concepts/tools) to look up things online\n",
 "- [`Chat History`](/docs/concepts/chat_history), which allows a chatbot to \"remember\" past interactions and take them into account when responding to followup questions. \n",
 "- Debugging and tracing your application using [LangSmith](/docs/concepts/#langsmith)\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
 "\n",
 "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "To install LangChain (and `cheerio` for the web loader) run:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " langchain @langchain/core cheerio\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation/).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
 "\n",
 "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
 "\n",
 "```shell\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
 "\n",
 "# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment\n",
 "# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true\n",
 "```\n"

 "# How to add values to a chain's state\n",

 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)\n",
 "- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)\n",
 "- [Calling runnables in parallel](/docs/how_to/parallel/)\n",
 "- [Custom functions](/docs/how_to/functions/)\n",
 "- [Passing data through](/docs/how_to/passthrough)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "An alternate way of [passing data through](/docs/how_to/passthrough) steps of a chain is to leave the current values of the chain state unchanged while assigning a new value under a given key. The [`RunnablePassthrough.assign()`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.RunnablePassthrough.html#assign-2) static method takes an input value and adds the extra arguments passed to the assign function.\n",
 "\n",

 "\n",
 "- The input to the chain is `{\"num\": 1}`. This is passed into a `RunnableParallel`, which invokes the runnables it is passed in parallel with that input.\n",
 "- The value under the `extra` key is invoked. `RunnablePassthrough.assign()` keeps the original keys in the input dict (`{\"num\": 1}`), and assigns a new key called `mult`. The value is `lambda x: x[\"num\"] * 3)`, which is `3`. Thus, the result is `{\"num\": 1, \"mult\": 3}`.\n",
 "- `{\"num\": 1, \"mult\": 3}` is returned to the `RunnableParallel` call, and is set as the value to the key `extra`.\n",
 "- At the same time, the `modified` key is called. The result is `2`, since the lambda extracts a key called `\"num\"` from its input and adds one.\n",
 "\n",
 "Thus, the result is `{'extra': {'num': 1, 'mult': 3}, 'modified': 2}`.\n",
 "\n",

# How to cache embedding results

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)

:::

Embeddings can be stored or temporarily cached to avoid needing to recompute them.

Caching embeddings can be done using a `CacheBackedEmbeddings` instance.

The cache backed embedder is a wrapper around an embedder that caches embeddings in a key-value store.

The text is hashed and the hash is used as the key in the cache.

The main supported way to initialized a `CacheBackedEmbeddings` is the `fromBytesStore` static method. This takes in the following parameters:

- `underlyingEmbeddings`: The embeddings model to use.
- `documentEmbeddingCache`: The cache to use for storing document embeddings.
- `namespace`: (optional, defaults to "") The namespace to use for document cache. This namespace is used to avoid collisions with other caches. For example, you could set it to the name of the embedding model used.

**Attention:** Be sure to set the namespace parameter to avoid collisions of the same text embedded using different embeddings models.

## In-memory

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Here's a basic test example with an in memory cache. This type of cache is primarily useful for unit tests or prototyping.
Do not use this cache if you need to actually store the embeddings for an extended period of time:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{InMemoryExample}</CodeBlock>

## Redis

Here's an example with a Redis cache.

You'll first need to install `ioredis` as a peer dependency and pass in an initialized client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ioredis
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RedisExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned how to use caching to avoid recomputing embeddings.

Next, check out the [full tutorial on retrieval-augmented generation](/docs/tutorials/rag).

 "# How to dispatch custom callback events\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks)\n",
 "- [Custom callback handlers](/docs/how_to/custom_callbacks)\n",
 "- [Stream Events API](/docs/concepts/streaming#streamevents)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "In some situations, you may want to dipsatch a custom callback event from within a [Runnable](/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface) so it can be surfaced\n",
 "in a custom callback handler or via the [Stream Events API](/docs/concepts/streaming#streamevents).\n",
 "\n",
 "For example, if you have a long running tool with multiple steps, you can dispatch custom events between the steps and use these custom events to monitor progress.\n",
 "You could also surface these custom events to an end user of your application to show them how the current task is progressing.\n",
 "\n",
 "To dispatch a custom event you need to decide on two attributes for the event: the `name` and the `data`.\n",
 "\n",
 "| Attribute | Type | Description |\n",
 "|-----------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
 "| name | string | A user defined name for the event. |\n",
 "| data | any | The data associated with the event. This can be anything, though we suggest making it JSON serializable. |\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info\n",
 "- Custom callback events can only be dispatched from within an existing `Runnable`.\n",
 "- If using `streamEvents`, you must use `version: \"v2\"` to consume custom events.\n",
 "- Sending or rendering custom callback events in LangSmith is not yet supported.\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "## Stream Events API\n",
 "\n",
 "The most useful way to consume custom events is via the [`.streamEvents()`](/docs/concepts/streaming#streamevents) method.\n",
 "\n",
 "We can use the `dispatchCustomEvent` API to emit custom events from this method. \n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::caution Compatibility\n",
 "Dispatching custom callback events requires `@langchain/core>=0.2.16`. See [this guide](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages) for some considerations to take when upgrading `@langchain/core`.\n",
 "\n",
 "The default entrypoint below triggers an import and initialization of [`async_hooks`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html) to enable automatic `RunnableConfig` passing, which is not supported in all environments. If you see import issues, you must import from `@langchain/core/callbacks/dispatch/web` and propagate the `RunnableConfig` object manually (see example below).\n",

 "In many cases, it is advantageous to pass in handlers instead when running the object. When we pass through [`CallbackHandlers`](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core.callbacks_base.CallbackHandlerMethods.html) using the `callbacks` keyword arg when executing an run, those callbacks will be issued by all nested objects involved in the execution. For example, when a handler is passed through to an Agent, it will be used for all callbacks related to the agent and all the objects involved in the agent's execution, in this case, the Tools and LLM.\n",

 "\n",
 "- [Callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "As of `@langchain/core@0.3.0`, LangChain.js callbacks run in the background. This means that execution will **not** wait for the callback to either return before continuing. Prior to `0.3.0`, this behavior was the opposite.\n",
 "\n",
 "If you are running code in [serverless environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) such as [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) or [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) you should set your callbacks to be blocking to allow them time to finish or timeout.\n",
 "\n",
 "To make callbacks blocking, set the `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` environment variable to `\"false\"`. Alternatively, you can import the global [`awaitAllCallbacks`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain_core.callbacks_promises.awaitAllCallbacks.html) method to ensure all callbacks finish if necessary.\n",
 "\n",
 "To illustrate this, we'll create a [custom callback handler](/docs/how_to/custom_callbacks) that takes some time to resolve, and show the timing with and without `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` set to `\"false\"`. Here it is without the variable set along with the `awaitAllCallbacks` global:"

# How to cache chat model responses

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [LLMs](/docs/concepts/text_llms)

:::

LangChain provides an optional caching layer for chat models. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same completion multiple times.
It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model.
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4",
 cache: true,
});
```

## In Memory Cache

The default cache is stored in-memory. This means that if you restart your application, the cache will be cleared.

```typescript
console.time();

// The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
const res = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res);

console.timeEnd();

/*
 AIMessage {
 lc_serializable: true,
 lc_kwargs: {
 content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
 additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
 },
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
 content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
 name: undefined,
 additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
 }
 default: 2.224s
*/
```

```typescript
console.time();

// The second time it is, so it goes faster
const res2 = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res2);

console.timeEnd();
/*
 AIMessage {
 lc_serializable: true,
 lc_kwargs: {
 content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
 additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
 },
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
 content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
 name: undefined,
 additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
 }
 default: 181.98ms
*/
```

## Caching with Redis

LangChain also provides a Redis-based cache. This is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers.
To use it, you'll need to install the `redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ioredis @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import RedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Upstash Redis

LangChain provides an Upstash Redis-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Upstash Redis client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@upstash/redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @upstash/redis
```

You'll also need an [Upstash account](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-account) and a [Redis database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import UpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/upstash_redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

You can also directly pass in a previously created [@upstash/redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/javascriptsdk/overview) client instance:

import AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/upstash_redis_advanced.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Vercel KV

LangChain provides an Vercel KV-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Vercel KV client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@vercel/kv` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @vercel/kv
```

You'll also need an Vercel account and a [KV database](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/kv-reference) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import VercelKVCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/vercel_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{VercelKVCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Cloudflare KV

:::info
This integration is only supported in Cloudflare Workers.
:::

If you're deploying your project as a Cloudflare Worker, you can use LangChain's Cloudflare KV-powered LLM cache.

For information on how to set up KV in Cloudflare, see [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

**Note:** If you are using TypeScript, you may need to install types if they aren't already present:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @cloudflare/workers-types
```

import CloudflareExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/cloudflare_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CloudflareExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching on the File System

:::warning
This cache is not recommended for production use. It is only intended for local development.
:::

LangChain provides a simple file system cache.
By default the cache is stored a temporary directory, but you can specify a custom directory if you want.

```typescript
const cache = await LocalFileCache.create();
```

## Next steps

You've now learned how to cache model responses to save time and money.

Next, check out the other how-to guides on chat models, like [how to get a model to return structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output) or [how to create your own custom chat model](/docs/how_to/custom_chat).

# How to init any model in one line

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Many LLM applications let end users specify what model provider and model they want the application to be powered by.
This requires writing some logic to initialize different ChatModels based on some user configuration.
The `initChatModel()` helper method makes it easy to initialize a number of different model integrations without having to worry about import paths and class names.
Keep in mind this feature is only for chat models.

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)

- [Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tools)

:::

:::caution Compatibility
**This feature is only intended to be used in Node environments. Use in non Node environments or with bundlers is not guaranteed to work and not officially supported.**

`initChatModel` requires `langchain>=0.2.11`. See [this guide](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages) for some considerations to take when upgrading.

See the [initChatModel()](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chat_models_universal.initChatModel.html) API reference for a full list of supported integrations.

Make sure you have the integration packages installed for any model providers you want to support. E.g. you should have `@langchain/openai` installed to init an OpenAI model.
:::

## Basic usage

import BasicExample from "@examples/models/chat/configurable/basic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

## Inferring model provider

For common and distinct model names `initChatModel()` will attempt to infer the model provider.
See the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chat_models_universal.initChatModel.html) for a full list of inference behavior.
E.g. any model that starts with `gpt-3...` or `gpt-4...` will be inferred as using model provider `openai`.

import InferringProviderExample from "@examples/models/chat/configurable/inferring_model_provider.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{InferringProviderExample}</CodeBlock>

## Creating a configurable model

You can also create a runtime-configurable model by specifying `configurableFields`.
If you don't specify a `model` value, then "model" and "modelProvider" be configurable by default.

import ConfigurableModelExample from "@examples/models/chat/configurable/configurable_model.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ConfigurableModelExample}</CodeBlock>

### Configurable model with default values

We can create a configurable model with default model values, specify which parameters are configurable, and add prefixes to configurable params:

import ConfigurableModelWithDefaultsExample from "@examples/models/chat/configurable/configurable_model_with_defaults.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
 {ConfigurableModelWithDefaultsExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Using a configurable model declaratively

We can call declarative operations like `bindTools`, `withStructuredOutput`, `withConfig`, etc. on a configurable model and chain a configurable model in the same way that we would a regularly instantiated chat model object.

import ConfigurableModelDeclarativelyExample from "@examples/models/chat/configurable/configurable_model_declaratively.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
 {ConfigurableModelDeclarativelyExample}
</CodeBlock>
```

# How to track token usage

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

:::

This notebook goes over how to track your token usage for specific calls.

## Using `AIMessage.usage_metadata`

A number of model providers return token usage information as part of the chat generation response. When available, this information will be included on the `AIMessage` objects produced by the corresponding model.

LangChain `AIMessage` objects include a [`usage_metadata`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.messages.AIMessage.html#usage_metadata) attribute for supported providers. When populated, this attribute will be an object with standard keys (e.g., "input_tokens" and "output_tokens").

#### OpenAI

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

import UsageMetadataExample from "@examples/models/chat/usage_metadata.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UsageMetadataExample}</CodeBlock>

#### Anthropic

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/core
```

import UsageMetadataExampleAnthropic from "@examples/models/chat/usage_metadata_anthropic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UsageMetadataExampleAnthropic}</CodeBlock>

## Using `AIMessage.response_metadata`

A number of model providers return token usage information as part of the chat generation response. When available, this is included in the `AIMessage.response_metadata` field.

#### OpenAI

import Example from "@examples/models/chat/token_usage_tracking.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

#### Anthropic

import AnthropicExample from "@examples/models/chat/token_usage_tracking_anthropic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AnthropicExample}</CodeBlock>

## Streaming

Some providers support token count metadata in a streaming context.

#### OpenAI

For example, OpenAI will return a message chunk at the end of a stream with token usage information. This behavior is supported by `@langchain/openai` >= 0.1.0 and can be enabled by passing a `stream_options` parameter when making your call.

:::info
By default, the last message chunk in a stream will include a `finish_reason` in the message's `response_metadata` attribute. If we include token usage in streaming mode, an additional chunk containing usage metadata will be added to the end of the stream, such that `finish_reason` appears on the second to last message chunk.
:::

import OpenAIStreamTokens from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_stream_tokens.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAIStreamTokens}</CodeBlock>

## Using callbacks

You can also use the `handleLLMEnd` callback to get the full output from the LLM, including token usage for supported models.
Here's an example of how you could do that:

import CallbackExample from "@examples/models/chat/token_usage_tracking_callback.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CallbackExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now seen a few examples of how to track chat model token usage for supported providers.

Next, check out the other how-to guides on chat models in this section, like [how to get a model to return structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output) or [how to add caching to your chat models](/docs/how_to/chat_model_caching).

 "- [Chatbots](/docs/concepts/messages)\n",

 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "This how-to guide previously built a chatbot using [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html).

# How to do retrieval with contextual compression

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag)

:::

One challenge with retrieval is that usually you don't know the specific queries your document storage system will face when you ingest data into the system. This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses.

Contextual compression is meant to fix this. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. “Compressing” here refers to both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale.

To use the Contextual Compression Retriever, you'll need:

- a base retriever
- a Document Compressor

The Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base retriever, takes the initial documents and passes them through the Document Compressor. The Document Compressor takes a list of documents and shortens it by reducing the contents of documents or dropping documents altogether.

## Using a vanilla vector store retriever

Let's start by initializing a simple vector store retriever and storing the 2023 State of the Union speech (in chunks).
Given an example question, our retriever returns one or two relevant docs and a few irrelevant docs, and even the relevant docs have a lot of irrelevant information in them.
To extract all the context we can, we use an `LLMChainExtractor`, which will iterate over the initially returned documents and extract from each only the content that is relevant to the query.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/contextual_compression.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## `EmbeddingsFilter`

Making an extra LLM call over each retrieved document is expensive and slow. The `EmbeddingsFilter` provides a cheaper and faster option by embedding the documents and query and only returning those documents which have sufficiently similar embeddings to the query.

This is most useful for non-vector store retrievers where we may not have control over the returned chunk size, or as part of a pipeline, outlined below.

Here's an example:

import EmbeddingsFilterExample from "@examples/retrievers/embeddings_filter.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{EmbeddingsFilterExample}</CodeBlock>

## Stringing compressors and document transformers together

Using the `DocumentCompressorPipeline` we can also easily combine multiple compressors in sequence. Along with compressors we can add BaseDocumentTransformers to our pipeline, which don't perform any contextual compression but simply perform some transformation on a set of documents.
For example `TextSplitters` can be used as document transformers to split documents into smaller pieces, and the `EmbeddingsFilter` can be used to filter out documents based on similarity of the individual chunks to the input query.

Below we create a compressor pipeline by first splitting raw webpage documents retrieved from the [Tavily web search API retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers/tavily) into smaller chunks, then filtering based on relevance to the query.
The result is smaller chunks that are semantically similar to the input query.
This skips the need to add documents to a vector store to perform similarity search, which can be useful for one-off use cases:

import DocumentCompressorPipelineExample from "@examples/retrievers/document_compressor_pipeline.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DocumentCompressorPipelineExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned a few ways to use contextual compression to remove bad data from your results.

See the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers, the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

 "# How to convert Runnables to Tools\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Runnables](/docs/concepts/runnables)\n",

 "- [Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For convenience, `Runnables` that accept a string or object input can be converted to tools using the [`asTool`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#asTool) method, which allows for the specification of names, descriptions, and additional schema information for arguments.\n",
 "\n",
 "Here we will demonstrate how to use this method to convert a LangChain `Runnable` into a tool that can be used by agents, chains, or chat models.\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::caution Compatibility\n",
 "\n",
 "This functionality requires `@langchain/core>=0.2.16`. Please see here for a [guide on upgrading](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "## `asTool`\n",
 "\n",
 "Tools have some additional requirements over general Runnables:\n",
 "\n",
 "- Their inputs are constrained to be serializable, specifically strings and objects;\n",
 "- They contain names and descriptions indicating how and when they should be used;\n",
 "- They contain a detailed `schema` property for their arguments. That is, while a tool (as a `Runnable`) might accept a single object input, the specific keys and type information needed to populate an object should be specified in the `schema` field.\n",
 "\n",
 "The `asTool()` method therefore requires this additional information to create a tool from a runnable. Here's a basic example:"

# How to write a custom retriever class

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)

:::

To create your own retriever, you need to extend the [`BaseRetriever`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html) class
and implement a `_getRelevantDocuments` method that takes a `string` as its first parameter (and an optional `runManager` for tracing).
This method should return an array of `Document`s fetched from some source. This process can involve calls to a database, to the web using `fetch`, or any other source.
Note the underscore before `_getRelevantDocuments()`. The base class wraps the non-prefixed version in order to automatically handle tracing of the original call.

Here's an example of a custom retriever that returns static documents:

```ts
import {
 BaseRetriever,
 type BaseRetrieverInput,
} from "@langchain/core/retrievers";
import type { CallbackManagerForRetrieverRun } from "@langchain/core/callbacks/manager";
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

export interface CustomRetrieverInput extends BaseRetrieverInput {}

export class CustomRetriever extends BaseRetriever {
 lc_namespace = ["langchain", "retrievers"];

 constructor(fields?: CustomRetrieverInput) {
 super(fields);
 }

 async _getRelevantDocuments(
 query: string,
 runManager?: CallbackManagerForRetrieverRun
 ): Promise<Document[]> {
 // Pass `runManager?.getChild()` when invoking internal runnables to enable tracing
 // const additionalDocs = await someOtherRunnable.invoke(params, runManager?.getChild());
 return [
 // ...additionalDocs,
 new Document({
 pageContent: `Some document pertaining to ${query}`,
 metadata: {},
 }),
 new Document({
 pageContent: `Some other document pertaining to ${query}`,
 metadata: {},
 }),
 ];
 }
}
```

Then, you can call `.invoke()` as follows:

```ts
const retriever = new CustomRetriever({});

await retriever.invoke("LangChain docs");
```

```
[
 Document {
 pageContent: 'Some document pertaining to LangChain docs',
 metadata: {}
 },
 Document {
 pageContent: 'Some other document pertaining to LangChain docs',
 metadata: {}
 }
]
```

## Next steps

You've now seen an example of implementing your own custom retriever.

Next, check out the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers, or the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag).

# How to load CSV data

> A [comma-separated values (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

Load CSV data with a single row per document.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install d3-dsv@2
```

## Usage, extracting all columns

Example CSV file:

```csv
id,text
1,This is a sentence.
2,This is another sentence.
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { CSVLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/csv";

const loader = new CSVLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv");

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "line": 1,
 "source": "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv",
 },
 "pageContent": "id: 1
text: This is a sentence.",
 },
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "line": 2,
 "source": "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv",
 },
 "pageContent": "id: 2
text: This is another sentence.",
 },
]
*/
```

## Usage, extracting a single column

Example CSV file:

```csv
id,text
1,This is a sentence.
2,This is another sentence.
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { CSVLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/csv";

const loader = new CSVLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv",
 "text"
);

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "line": 1,
 "source": "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is a sentence.",
 },
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "line": 2,
 "source": "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.csv",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is another sentence.",
 },
]
*/
```

# How to write a custom document loader

If you want to implement your own Document Loader, you have a few options.

### Subclassing `BaseDocumentLoader`

You can extend the `BaseDocumentLoader` class directly. The `BaseDocumentLoader` class provides a few convenience methods for loading documents from a variety of sources.

```typescript
abstract class BaseDocumentLoader implements DocumentLoader {
 abstract load(): Promise<Document[]>;
}
```

### Subclassing `TextLoader`

If you want to load documents from a text file, you can extend the `TextLoader` class. The `TextLoader` class takes care of reading the file, so all you have to do is implement a parse method.

```typescript
abstract class TextLoader extends BaseDocumentLoader {
 abstract parse(raw: string): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

### Subclassing `BufferLoader`

If you want to load documents from a binary file, you can extend the `BufferLoader` class. The `BufferLoader` class takes care of reading the file, so all you have to do is implement a parse method.

```typescript
abstract class BufferLoader extends BaseDocumentLoader {
 abstract parse(
 raw: Buffer,
 metadata: Document["metadata"]
 ): Promise<Document[]>;
}
```
```

# How to load data from a directory

This covers how to load all documents in a directory.

The second argument is a map of file extensions to loader factories. Each file will be passed to the matching loader, and the resulting documents will be concatenated together.

Example folder:

```text
src/document_loaders/example_data/example/
├── example.json
├── example.jsonl
├── example.txt
└── example.csv
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { DirectoryLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/directory";
import {
 JSONLoader,
 JSONLinesLoader,
} from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CSVLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/csv";

const loader = new DirectoryLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/example_data/example",
 {
 ".json": (path) => new JSONLoader(path, "/texts"),
 ".jsonl": (path) => new JSONLinesLoader(path, "/html"),
 ".txt": (path) => new TextLoader(path),
 ".csv": (path) => new CSVLoader(path, "text"),
 }
);
const docs = await loader.load();
console.log({ docs });
```

# How to load PDF files

> [Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

This covers how to load `PDF` documents into the Document format that we use downstream.

By default, one document will be created for each page in the PDF file. You can change this behavior by setting the `splitPages` option to `false`.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pdf-parse
```

## Usage, one document per page

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";
// Or, in web environments:
// import { WebPDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/pdf";
// const blob = new Blob(); // e.g. from a file input
// const loader = new WebPDFLoader(blob);

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Usage, one document per file

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
 splitPages: false,
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Usage, custom `pdfjs` build

By default we use the `pdfjs` build bundled with `pdf-parse`, which is compatible with most environments, including Node.js and modern browsers. If you want to use a more recent version of `pdfjs-dist` or if you want to use a custom build of `pdfjs-dist`, you can do so by providing a custom `pdfjs` function that returns a promise that resolves to the `PDFJS` object.

In the following example we use the "legacy" (see [pdfjs docs](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsersenvironments-are-supported)) build of `pdfjs-dist`, which includes several polyfills not included in the default build.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pdfjs-dist
```

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
 // you may need to add `.then(m => m.default)` to the end of the import
 pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});
```

## Eliminating extra spaces

PDFs come in many varieties, which makes reading them a challenge. The loader parses individual text elements and joins them together with a space by default, but
if you are seeing excessive spaces, this may not be the desired behavior. In that case, you can override the separator with an empty string like this:

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
 parsedItemSeparator: "",
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```
```

# How to load JSON data

> [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).

> [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a file format where each line is a valid JSON value.

The JSON loader uses [JSON pointer](https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer) to target keys in your JSON files you want to target.

### No JSON pointer example

The most simple way of using it is to specify no JSON pointer.
The loader will load all strings it finds in the JSON object.

Example JSON file:

```json
{
 "texts": ["This is a sentence.", "This is another sentence."]
}
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json");

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 1,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is a sentence.",
 },
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 2,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is another sentence.",
 },
]
*/
```

### Using JSON pointer example

You can do a more advanced scenario by choosing which keys in your JSON object you want to extract string from.

In this example, we want to only extract information from "from" and "surname" entries.

```json
{
 "1": {
 "body": "BD 2023 SUMMER",
 "from": "LinkedIn Job",
 "labels": ["IMPORTANT", "CATEGORY_UPDATES", "INBOX"]
 },
 "2": {
 "body": "Intern, Treasury and other roles are available",
 "from": "LinkedIn Job2",
 "labels": ["IMPORTANT"],
 "other": {
 "name": "plop",
 "surname": "bob"
 }
 }
}
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json",
 ["/from", "/surname"]
);

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 pageContent: 'LinkedIn Job',
 metadata: { source: './src/json/example.json', line: 1 }
 },
 Document {
 pageContent: 'LinkedIn Job2',
 metadata: { source: './src/json/example.json', line: 2 }
 },
 Document {
 pageContent: 'bob',
 metadata: { source: './src/json/example.json', line: 3 }
 }
]
**/
```
```

# How to embed text data

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding) for documentation on built-in integrations with text embedding providers.
:::

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)

:::

Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space.

The base Embeddings class in LangChain exposes two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself).

## Get started

Below is an example of how to use the OpenAI embeddings. Embeddings occasionally have different embedding methods for queries versus documents, so the embedding class exposes a `embedQuery` and `embedDocuments` method.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

## Get started

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings();
```

## Embed queries

```typescript
const res = await embeddings.embedQuery("Hello world");

# How to combine results from multiple retrievers

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Documents](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html)
- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)

:::

The [EnsembleRetriever](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_ensemble.EnsembleRetriever.html) supports ensembling of results from multiple retrievers. It is initialized with a list of [BaseRetriever](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html) objects. EnsembleRetrievers rerank the results of the constituent retrievers based on the [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) algorithm.

By leveraging the strengths of different algorithms, the `EnsembleRetriever` can achieve better performance than any single algorithm.

One useful pattern is to combine a keyword matching retriever with a dense retriever (like embedding similarity), because their strengths are complementary. This can be considered a form of "hybrid search". The sparse retriever is good at finding relevant documents based on keywords, while the dense retriever is good at finding relevant documents based on semantic similarity.

Below we demonstrate ensembling of a [simple custom retriever](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/) that simply returns documents that directly contain the input query with a retriever derived from a [demo, in-memory, vector store](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.vectorstores_memory.MemoryVectorStore.html).

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/ensemble_retriever.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned how to combine results from multiple retrievers.
Next, check out some other retrieval how-to guides, such as how to [improve results using multiple embeddings per document](/docs/how_to/multi_vector)
or how to [create your own custom retriever](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever).

# How to select examples by length

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)
- [Example selectors](/docs/how_to/example_selectors)

:::

This example selector selects which examples to use based on length.
This is useful when you are worried about constructing a prompt that will go over the length of the context window.
For longer inputs, it will select fewer examples to include, while for shorter inputs it will select more.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleLength from "@examples/prompts/length_based_example_selector.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleLength}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned a bit about using a length based example selector.

Next, check out this guide on how to use a [similarity based example selector](/docs/how_to/example_selectors_similarity).
```

# How to select examples by similarity

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)
- [Example selectors](/docs/how_to/example_selectors)
- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)

:::

This object selects examples based on similarity to the inputs.
It does this by finding the examples with the embeddings that have the greatest cosine similarity with the inputs.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleSimilarity from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector.ts";

The fields of the examples object will be used as parameters to format the `examplePrompt` passed to the `FewShotPromptTemplate`.
Each example should therefore contain all required fields for the example prompt you are using.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarity}</CodeBlock>

By default, each field in the examples object is concatenated together, embedded, and stored in the vectorstore for
later similarity search against user queries.

If you only want to embed specific keys
(e.g., you only want to search for examples that have a similar query to the one the user provides), you can pass an `inputKeys`
array in the final `options` parameter.

## Loading from an existing vectorstore

You can also use a pre-initialized vector store by passing an instance to the `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` constructor
directly, as shown below. You can also add more examples via the `addExample` method:

import ExampleSimilarityFromExisting from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector_from_existing.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarityFromExisting}</CodeBlock>

## Metadata filtering

When adding examples, each field is available as metadata in the produced document. If you would like further control over your
search space, you can add extra fields to your examples and pass a `filter` parameter when initializing your selector:

import ExampleSimilarityMetadataFiltering from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector_metadata_filtering.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
 {ExampleSimilarityMetadataFiltering}
</CodeBlock>

## Custom vectorstore retrievers

You can also pass a vectorstore retriever instead of a vectorstore. One way this could be useful is if you want to use retrieval
besides similarity search such as maximal marginal relevance:

import ExampleSimilarityCustomRetriever from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector_custom_retriever.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarityCustomRetriever}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned a bit about using similarity in an example selector.

Next, check out this guide on how to use a [length-based example selector](/docs/how_to/example_selectors_length_based).

# Fallbacks

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)

:::

When working with language models, you may encounter issues from the underlying APIs, e.g. rate limits or downtime.
As you move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to have contingencies for errors.
That's why we've introduced the concept of fallbacks.

Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level.
This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don't just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want want to use e.g. a different prompt template.

## Handling LLM API errors

This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down,
you could have hit a rate limit, or any number of things.

**IMPORTANT:** By default, many of LangChain's LLM wrappers catch errors and retry.
You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying rather than failing.

import ModelExample from "@examples/guides/fallbacks/model.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ModelExample}</CodeBlock>

## Fallbacks for RunnableSequences

We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves.
Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model).
Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt.

import ChainExample from "@examples/guides/fallbacks/chain.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChainExample}</CodeBlock>

## Handling long inputs

One of the big limiting factors of LLMs in their context window.
Sometimes you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM,
but in situations where that is hard/complicated you can fallback to a model with longer context length.

import LongInputExample from "@examples/guides/fallbacks/long_inputs.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LongInputExample}</CodeBlock>

## Fallback to a better model

Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle.
This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with a faster and cheaper model, but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4.

import BetterModelExample from "@examples/guides/fallbacks/better_model.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BetterModelExample}</CodeBlock>

 "# How to use few shot examples in chat models\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide covers how to prompt a chat model with example inputs and outputs. Providing the model with a few such examples is called few-shotting, and is a simple yet powerful way to guide generation and in some cases drastically improve model performance.\n",
 "\n",
 "There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.prompts.FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate.html) as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit.\n",
 "\n",
 "The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Note:** The following code examples are for chat models only, since `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplates` are designed to output formatted [chat messages](/docs/concepts/messages) rather than pure strings. For similar few-shot prompt examples for pure string templates compatible with completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/how_to/few_shot_examples/) guide.\n",

 "## Fixed Examples\n",
 "\n",
 "The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use fixed prompt examples. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production.\n",
 "\n",
 "The basic components of the template are:\n",
 "- `examples`: An array of object examples to include in the final prompt.\n",
 "- `examplePrompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [`formatMessages`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.prompts.FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate.html#formatMessages) method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message.\n",

# Few Shot Prompt Templates

Few shot prompting is a prompting technique which provides the Large Language Model (LLM) with a list of examples, and then asks the LLM to generate some text following the lead of the examples provided.

An example of this is the following:

Say you want your LLM to respond in a specific format. You can few shot prompt the LLM with a list of question answer pairs so it knows what format to respond in.

```txt
Respond to the users question in the with the following format:

Question: What is your name?
Answer: My name is John.

Question: What is your age?
Answer: I am 25 years old.

Question: What is your favorite color?
Answer:
```

Here we left the last `Answer:` undefined so the LLM can fill it in. The LLM will then generate the following:

```txt
Answer: I don't have a favorite color; I don't have preferences.
```

### Use Case

In the following example we're few shotting the LLM to rephrase questions into more general queries.

We provide two sets of examples with specific questions, and rephrased general questions. The `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate` will use our examples and when `.format` is called, we'll see those examples formatted into a string we can pass to the LLM.

```typescript
import {
 ChatPromptTemplate,
 FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate,
} from "langchain/prompts";
```

```typescript
const examples = [
 {
 input: "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?",
 output: "what can the members of The Police do?",
 },
 {
 input: "Jan Sindel's was born in what country?",
 output: "what is Jan Sindel's personal history?",
 },
];
const examplePrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`Human: {input}
AI: {output}`);
const fewShotPrompt = new FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate({
 examplePrompt,
 examples,
 inputVariables: [], // no input variables
});
```

```typescript
const formattedPrompt = await fewShotPrompt.format({});
console.log(formattedPrompt);
```

```typescript
[
 HumanMessage {
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain', 'schema' ],
 content: 'Human: Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?\n' +
 'AI: what can the members of The Police do?',
 additional_kwargs: {}
 },
 HumanMessage {
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain', 'schema' ],
 content: "Human: Jan Sindel's was born in what country?\n" +
 "AI: what is Jan Sindel's personal history?",
 additional_kwargs: {}
 }
]
```

Then, if we use this with another question, the LLM will rephrase the question how we want.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({});
const examples = [
 {
 input: "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?",
 output: "what can the members of The Police do?",
 },
 {
 input: "Jan Sindel's was born in what country?",
 output: "what is Jan Sindel's personal history?",
 },
];
const examplePrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`Human: {input}
AI: {output}`);
const fewShotPrompt = new FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate({
 prefix:
 "Rephrase the users query to be more general, using the following examples",
 suffix: "Human: {input}",
 examplePrompt,
 examples,
 inputVariables: ["input"],
});
const formattedPrompt = await fewShotPrompt.format({
 input: "What's France's main city?",
});

const response = await model.invoke(formattedPrompt);
console.log(response);
```

```typescript
AIMessage {
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain', 'schema' ],
 content: 'What is the capital of France?',
 additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined }
}
```

### Few Shotting With Functions

You can also partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables can be tedious. In this case, it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.

```typescript
const getCurrentDate = () => {
 return new Date().toISOString();
};

const prompt = new FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate({
 template: "Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}",
 inputVariables: ["adjective", "date"],
});

const partialPrompt = await prompt.partial({
 date: getCurrentDate,
});

const formattedPrompt = await partialPrompt.format({
 adjective: "funny",
});

console.log(formattedPrompt);

// Tell me a funny joke about the day 2023-07-13T00:54:59.287Z
```

### Few Shot vs Chat Few Shot

The chat and non chat few shot prompt templates act in a similar way. The below example will demonstrate using chat and non chat, and the differences with their outputs.

```typescript
import {
 FewShotPromptTemplate,
 FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate,
} from "langchain/prompts";
```

```typescript
const examples = [
 {
 input: "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?",
 output: "what can the members of The Police do?",
 },
 {
 input: "Jan Sindel's was born in what country?",
 output: "what is Jan Sindel's personal history?",
 },
];
const prompt = `Human: {input}
AI: {output}`;
const examplePromptTemplate = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(prompt);
const exampleChatPromptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(prompt);
const chatFewShotPrompt = new FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate({
 examplePrompt: exampleChatPromptTemplate,
 examples,
 inputVariables: [], // no input variables
});
const fewShotPrompt = new FewShotPromptTemplate({
 examplePrompt: examplePromptTemplate,
 examples,
 inputVariables: [], // no input variables
});
```

```typescript
console.log("Chat Few Shot: ", await chatFewShotPrompt.formatMessages({}));
/**
Chat Few Shot: [
 HumanMessage {
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain', 'schema' ],
 content: 'Human: Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?\n' +
 'AI: what can the members of The Police do?',
 additional_kwargs: {}
 },
 HumanMessage {
 lc_namespace: [ 'langchain', 'schema' ],
 content: "Human: Jan Sindel's was born in what country?\n" +
 "AI: what is Jan Sindel's personal history?",
 additional_kwargs: {}
 }
]
 */
```

```typescript
console.log("Few Shot: ", await fewShotPrompt.formatPromptValue({}));
/**
Few Shot:

Human: Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?
AI: what can the members of The Police do?

Human: Jan Sindel's was born in what country?
AI: what is Jan Sindel's personal history?
 */
```

Here we can see the main distinctions between `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate` and `FewShotPromptTemplate`: input and output values.

`FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate` works by taking in a list of `ChatPromptTemplate` for examples, and its output is a list of instances of `BaseMessage`.

On the other hand, `FewShotPromptTemplate` works by taking in a `PromptTemplate` for examples, and its output is a string.

## With Non Chat Models

LangChain also provides a class for few shot prompt formatting for non chat models: `FewShotPromptTemplate`. The API is largely the same, but the output is formatted differently (chat messages vs strings).

### Partials With Functions

```typescript
import {
 ChatPromptTemplate,
 FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate,
} from "langchain/prompts";
```

```typescript
const examplePrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("{foo}{bar}");
const prompt = new FewShotPromptTemplate({
 prefix: "{foo}{bar}",
 examplePrompt,
 inputVariables: ["foo", "bar"],
});
const partialPrompt = await prompt.partial({
 foo: () => Promise.resolve("boo"),
});
const formatted = await partialPrompt.format({ bar: "baz" });
console.log(formatted);
```

```txt
boobaz\n
```

### With Functions and Example Selector

```typescript
import {
 ChatPromptTemplate,
 FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate,
} from "langchain/prompts";
```

```typescript
const examplePrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("An example about {x}");
const exampleSelector = await LengthBasedExampleSelector.fromExamples(
 [{ x: "foo" }, { x: "bar" }],
 { examplePrompt, maxLength: 200 }
);
const prompt = new FewShotPromptTemplate({
 prefix: "{foo}{bar}",
 exampleSelector,
 examplePrompt,
 inputVariables: ["foo", "bar"],
});
const partialPrompt = await prompt.partial({
 foo: () => Promise.resolve("boo"),
});
const formatted = await partialPrompt.format({ bar: "baz" });
console.log(formatted);
```

```txt
boobaz
An example about foo
An example about bar
```
```

# How to build an LLM generated UI

This guide will walk through some high level concepts and code snippets for building generative UI's using LangChain.js. To see the full code for generative UI, [click here to visit our official LangChain Next.js template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/main/app/generative_ui/README.md).

The sample implements a tool calling agent, which outputs an interactive UI element when streaming intermediate outputs of tool calls to the client.

We introduce two utilities which wraps the AI SDK to make it easier to yield React elements inside runnables and tool calls: [`createRunnableUI`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/7f764d558682214d50b064f4293667123a31e6fe/app/generative_ui/utils/server.tsx#L89)
and [`streamRunnableUI`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/7f764d558682214d50b064f4293667123a31e6fe/app/generative_ui/utils/server.tsx#L126).

- The `streamRunnableUI` executes the provided Runnable with `streamEvents` method and sends every `stream` event to the client via the React Server Components stream.
- The `createRunnableUI` wraps the `createStreamableUI` function from AI SDK to properly hook into the Runnable event stream.

The usage is then as follows:

```tsx ai/chain.tsx
"use server";

const tool = tool(
 async (input, config) => {
 const stream = await createRunnableUI(config);
 stream.update(<div>Searching...</div>);

 const result = await images(input);
 stream.done(
 <Images
 images={result.images_results
 .map((image) => image.thumbnail)
 .slice(0, input.limit)}
 />
 );

 return `[Returned ${result.images_results.length} images]`;
 },
 {
 name: "Images",
 description: "A tool to search for images. input should be a search query.",
 schema: z.object({
 query: z.string().describe("The search query used to search for cats"),
 limit: z.number().describe("The number of pictures shown to the user"),
 }),
 }
);

// add LLM, prompt, etc...

const tools = [tool];

export const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
 agent: createToolCallingAgent({ llm, tools, prompt }),
 tools,
});
```

:::tip
As of `langchain` version `0.2.8`, the `createToolCallingAgent` function now supports [OpenAI-formatted tools](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core.language_models_base.ToolDefinition.html).
:::

```tsx agent.tsx
async function agent(inputs: {
 input: string;
 chat_history: [role: string, content: string][];
}) {
 "use server";

 return streamRunnableUI(agentExecutor, {
 input: inputs.input,
 chat_history: inputs.chat_history.map(
 ([role, content]) => new ChatMessage(content, role)
 ),
 });
}

export const EndpointsContext = exposeEndpoints({ agent });
```

In order to ensure all of the client components are included in the bundle, we need to wrap all of the Server Actions into `exposeEndpoints` method. These endpoints will be accessible from the client via the Context API, seen in the `useActions` hook.

```tsx
"use client";
import type { EndpointsContext } from "./agent";

export default function Page() {
 const actions = useActions<typeof EndpointsContext>();
 const [node, setNode] = useState();

 return (
 <div>
 {node}

 <button
 onClick={async () => {
 setNode(await actions.agent({ input: "cats" }));
 }}
 >
 Get images of cats
 </button>
 </div>
 );
}
```
```

# How to reindex data to keep your vectorstore in-sync with the underlying data source

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag/)
- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)

:::

Here, we will look at a basic indexing workflow using the LangChain indexing API.

The indexing API lets you load and keep in sync documents from any source into a vector store. Specifically, it helps:

- Avoid writing duplicated content into the vector store
- Avoid re-writing unchanged content
- Avoid re-computing embeddings over unchanged content

All of which should save you time and money, as well as improve your vector search results.

Crucially, the indexing API will work even with documents that have gone through several transformation steps (e.g., via text chunking) with respect to the original source documents.

## How it works

LangChain indexing makes use of a record manager (`RecordManager`) that keeps track of document writes into the vector store.

When indexing content, hashes are computed for each document, and the following information is stored in the record manager:

- the document hash (hash of both page content and metadata)
- write time
- the source ID - each document should include information in its metadata to allow us to determine the ultimate source of this document

## Deletion Modes

When indexing documents into a vector store, it's possible that some existing documents in the vector store should be deleted.
In certain situations you may want to remove any existing documents that are derived from the same sources as the new documents being indexed.
In others you may want to delete all existing documents wholesale. The indexing API deletion modes let you pick the behavior you want:

| Cleanup Mode | De-Duplicates Content | Parallelizable | Cleans Up Deleted Source Docs | Cleans Up Mutations of Source Docs and/or Derived Docs | Clean Up Timing |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| None | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | - |
| Incremental | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Continuously |
| Full | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | At end of indexing |

`None` does not do any automatic clean up, allowing the user to manually do clean up of old content.

`incremental` and `full` offer the following automated clean up:

- If the content of the source document or derived documents has changed, both `incremental` or `full` modes will clean up (delete) previous versions of the content.
- If the source document has been deleted (meaning it is not included in the documents currently being indexed), the full cleanup mode will delete it from the vector store correctly, but the `incremental` mode will not.

When content is mutated (e.g., the source PDF file was revised) there will be a period of time during indexing when both the new and old versions may be returned to the user. This happens after the new content was written, but before the old version was deleted.

- `incremental` indexing minimizes this period of time as it is able to do clean up continuously, as it writes.
- `full` mode does the clean up after all batches have been written.

## Requirements

1. Do not use with a store that has been pre-populated with content independently of the indexing API, as the record manager will not know that records have been inserted previously.
2. Only works with LangChain `vectorstore`'s that support:
 a). document addition by id (`addDocuments` method with ids argument)
 b). delete by id (delete method with ids argument)

Compatible Vectorstores: [`PGVector`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector), [`Chroma`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma), [`CloudflareVectorize`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/cloudflare_vectorize),
[`ElasticVectorSearch`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/elasticsearch), [`FAISS`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss), [`MomentoVectorIndex`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/momento_vector_index),
[`Pinecone`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone), [`SupabaseVectorStore`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase), [`VercelPostgresVectorStore`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/vercel_postgres),
[`Weaviate`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate), [`Xata`](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/xata)

## Caution

The record manager relies on a time-based mechanism to determine what content can be cleaned up (when using `full` or `incremental` cleanup modes).

If two tasks run back-to-back, and the first task finishes before the clock time changes, then the second task may not be able to clean up content.

This is unlikely to be an issue in actual settings for the following reasons:

1. The `RecordManager` uses higher resolution timestamps.
2. The data would need to change between the first and the second tasks runs, which becomes unlikely if the time interval between the tasks is small.
3. Indexing tasks typically take more than a few ms.

## Quickstart

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import QuickStartExample from "@examples/indexes/indexing_api/indexing.ts";

# Installation

## Supported Environments

LangChain is written in TypeScript and can be used in:

- Node.js (ESM and CommonJS) - 18.x, 19.x, 20.x
- Cloudflare Workers
- Vercel / Next.js (Browser, Serverless and Edge functions)
- Supabase Edge Functions
- Browser
- Deno
- Bun

However, note that individual integrations may not be supported in all environments.

## Installation

To install the main `langchain` package, run:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

```bash npm2yarn
npm install langchain @langchain/core
```

While this package acts as a sane starting point to using LangChain,
much of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.
We'll show how to do that in the next sections of this guide.

Please also see the section on [installing integration packages](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages)
for some special considerations when installing LangChain packages.

## Ecosystem packages

With the exception of the `langsmith` SDK, all packages in the LangChain ecosystem depend on `@langchain/core`, which contains base
classes and abstractions that other packages use. The dependency graph below shows how the difference packages are related.
A directed arrow indicates that the source package depends on the target package:

![](/img/ecosystem_packages.png)

**Note:** It is important that your app only uses one version of `@langchain/core`. Common package managers may introduce additional versions
when resolving direct dependencies, even if you don't intend this. See [this section on installing integration packages](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages)
for more information and ways to remedy this.

### @langchain/community

The [@langchain/community](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package contains a range of third-party integrations.
Install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

There are also more granular packages containing LangChain integrations for individual providers.

### @langchain/core

The [@langchain/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core) package contains base abstractions that the rest of the LangChain ecosystem uses, along with the LangChain Expression Language.
It should be installed separately:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/core
```

### LangGraph

[LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
It integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.

Install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

### LangSmith SDK

The LangSmith SDK is automatically installed by LangChain.
If you're not using it with LangChain, install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install langsmith
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

## Installing integration packages

LangChain supports packages that contain module integrations with individual third-party providers.
They can be as specific as [`@langchain/anthropic`](/docs/integrations/platforms/anthropic/), which contains integrations just for Anthropic models,
or as broad as [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community), which contains broader variety of community contributed integrations.

These packages, as well as the main LangChain package, all have [`@langchain/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core) as a peer dependency
to avoid package managers installing multiple versions of the same package. It contains the base abstractions that these integration packages extend.

To ensure that all integrations and their types interact with each other properly, it is important that they all use the same version of `@langchain/core`.
If you encounter type errors around base classes, you may need to guarantee that your package manager is resolving a single version of `@langchain/core`. To do so,
you can add a `"resolutions"` or `"overrides"` field like the following in your project's `package.json`. The name will depend on your package manager:

:::tip
The `resolutions` or `pnpm.overrides` fields for `yarn` or `pnpm` must be set in the root `package.json` file.
:::

If you are using `yarn`:

```json title="yarn package.json"
{
 "name": "your-project",
 "version": "0.0.0",
 "private": true,
 "engines": {
 "node": ">=18"
 },
 "dependencies": {
 "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
 "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
 "langchain": "0.0.207"
 },
 "resolutions": {
 "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
 }
}
```

You can also try running the [`yarn dedupe`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dedupe) command if you are on `yarn` version 2 or higher.

Or for `npm`:

```json title="npm package.json"
{
 "name": "your-project",
 "version": "0.0.0",
 "private": true,
 "engines": {
 "node": ">=18"
 },
 "dependencies": {
 "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
 "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
 "langchain": "0.0.207"
 },
 "overrides": {
 "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
 }
}
```

You can also try the [`npm dedupe`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-dedupe) command.

Or for `pnpm`:

```json title="pnpm package.json"
{
 "name": "your-project",
 "version": "0.0.0",
 "private": true,
 "engines": {
 "node": ">=18"
 },
 "dependencies": {
 "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
 "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
 "langchain": "0.0.207"
 },
 "pnpm": {
 "overrides": {
 "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
 }
 }
}
```

You can also try the [`pnpm dedupe`](https://pnpm.io/cli/dedupe) command.

## Loading the library

### TypeScript

LangChain is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for all of its public APIs.

### ESM

LangChain provides an ESM build targeting Node.js environments. You can import it using the following syntax:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

If you are using TypeScript in an ESM project we suggest updating your `tsconfig.json` to include the following:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
 "compilerOptions": {
 ...
 "target": "ES2020", // or higher
 "module": "nodenext",
 }
}
```

### CommonJS

LangChain provides a CommonJS build targeting Node.js environments. You can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
const { ChatOpenAI } = require("@langchain/openai");
```

### Cloudflare Workers

LangChain can be used in Cloudflare Workers. You can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

### Vercel / Next.js

LangChain can be used in Vercel / Next.js. We support using LangChain in frontend components, in Serverless functions and in Edge functions. You can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

### Deno / Supabase Edge Functions

LangChain can be used in Deno / Supabase Edge Functions. You can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "https://esm.sh/@langchain/openai";
```

or

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "npm:@langchain/openai";
```

### Browser

LangChain can be used in the browser. In our CI we test bundling LangChain with Webpack and Vite, but other bundlers should work too. You can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

## Unsupported: Node.js 16

We do not support Node.js 16, but if you still want to run LangChain on Node.js 16, you will need to follow the instructions in this section. We do not guarantee that these instructions will continue to work in the future.

You will have to make `fetch` available globally, either:

- run your application with `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-fetch' node ...`, or
- install `node-fetch` and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#providing-global-access)

You'll also need to [polyfill `ReadableStream`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill) by installing:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i web-streams-polyfill@4
```

And then adding it to the global namespace in your main entrypoint:

```typescript
import "web-streams-polyfill/polyfill";
```

Additionally you'll have to polyfill `structuredClone`, eg. by installing `core-js` and following the instructions [here](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

If you are running Node.js 18+, you do not need to do anything.

# How to cache model responses

LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same completion multiple times.
It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new OpenAI({
 model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
 cache: true,
});
```

## In Memory Cache

The default cache is stored in-memory. This means that if you restart your application, the cache will be cleared.

```typescript
console.time();

// The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
const res = await model.invoke("Tell me a long joke");

console.log(res);

console.timeEnd();

/*
 A man walks into a bar and sees a jar filled with money on the counter. Curious, he asks the bartender about it.

 The bartender explains, "We have a challenge for our customers. If you can complete three tasks, you win all the money in the jar."

 Intrigued, the man asks what the tasks are.

 The bartender replies, "First, you have to drink a whole bottle of tequila without making a face. Second, there's a pitbull out back with a sore tooth. You have to pull it out. And third, there's an old lady upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to give her one."

 The man thinks for a moment and then confidently says, "I'll do it."

 He grabs the bottle of tequila and downs it in one gulp, without flinching. He then heads to the back and after a few minutes of struggling, emerges with the pitbull's tooth in hand.

 The bar erupts in cheers and the bartender leads the man upstairs to the old lady's room. After a few minutes, the man walks out with a big smile on his face and the old lady is giggling with delight.

 The bartender hands the man the jar of money and asks, "How

 default: 4.187s
*/
```

```typescript
console.time();

// The second time it is, so it goes faster
const res2 = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke");

console.log(res2);

console.timeEnd();

## Caching with Momento

LangChain also provides a Momento-based cache. [Momento](https://gomomento.com) is a distributed, serverless cache that requires zero setup or infrastructure maintenance. Given Momento's compatibility with Node.js, browser, and edge environments, ensure you install the relevant package.

To install for **Node.js**:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @gomomento/sdk
```

To install for **browser/edge workers**:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @gomomento/sdk-web
```

Next you'll need to sign up and create an API key. Once you've done that, pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM like this:

import MomentoCacheExample from "@examples/cache/momento.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MomentoCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Redis

LangChain also provides a Redis-based cache. This is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. To use it, you'll need to install the `redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ioredis
```

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { RedisCache } from "@langchain/community/caches/ioredis";
import { Redis } from "ioredis";

// See https://github.com/redis/ioredis for connection options
const client = new Redis({});

const cache = new RedisCache(client);

const model = new OpenAI({ cache });
```

## Caching with Upstash Redis

LangChain provides an Upstash Redis-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Upstash Redis client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@upstash/redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @upstash/redis
```

You'll also need an [Upstash account](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-account) and a [Redis database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import UpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/upstash_redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

You can also directly pass in a previously created [@upstash/redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/javascriptsdk/overview) client instance:

import AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/upstash_redis_advanced.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Vercel KV

LangChain provides an Vercel KV-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Vercel KV client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@vercel/kv` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @vercel/kv
```

You'll also need an Vercel account and a [KV database](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/kv-reference) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import VercelKVCacheExample from "@examples/cache/vercel_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{VercelKVCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Cloudflare KV

:::info
This integration is only supported in Cloudflare Workers.
:::

If you're deploying your project as a Cloudflare Worker, you can use LangChain's Cloudflare KV-powered LLM cache.

For information on how to set up KV in Cloudflare, see [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

**Note:** If you are using TypeScript, you may need to install types if they aren't already present:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @cloudflare/workers-types
```

import CloudflareExample from "@examples/cache/cloudflare_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CloudflareExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching on the File System

:::warning
This cache is not recommended for production use. It is only intended for local development.
:::

LangChain provides a simple file system cache.
By default the cache is stored a temporary directory, but you can specify a custom directory if you want.

```typescript
const cache = await LocalFileCache.create();
```

## Next steps

You've now learned how to cache model responses to save time and money.

Next, check out the other how-to guides on LLMs, like [how to create your own custom LLM class](/docs/how_to/custom_llm).

# How to track token usage

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LLMs](/docs/concepts/text_llms)

:::

This notebook goes over how to track your token usage for specific LLM calls. This is only implemented by some providers, including OpenAI.

Here's an example of tracking token usage for a single LLM call via a callback:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/models/llm/token_usage_tracking.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

If this model is passed to a chain or agent that calls it multiple times, it will log an output each time.

## Next steps

You've now seen how to get token usage for supported LLM providers.

Next, check out the other how-to guides in this section, like [how to implement your own custom LLM](/docs/how_to/custom_llm).

 "# How to add message history\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)\n",
 "- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)\n",
 "- [Chat Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide previously covered the [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html) abstraction. You can access this version of the guide in the [v0.2 docs](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/message_history/).\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangGraph implementation offers a number of advantages over `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, including the ability to persist arbitrary components of an application's state (instead of only messages).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "Passing conversation state into and out a chain is vital when building a chatbot. LangGraph implements a built-in persistence layer, allowing chain states to be automatically persisted in memory, or external backends such as SQLite, Postgres or Redis. Details can be found in the LangGraph persistence documentation.\n",
 "\n",
 "In this guide we demonstrate how to add persistence to arbitrary LangChain runnables by wrapping them in a minimal LangGraph application. This lets us persist the message history and other elements of the chain's state, simplifying the development of multi-turn applications. It also supports multiple threads, enabling a single application to interact separately with multiple users.\n",

# How to generate multiple embeddings per document

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag)

:::

Embedding different representations of an original document, then returning the original document when any of the representations result in a search hit, can allow you to
tune and improve your retrieval performance. LangChain has a base [`MultiVectorRetriever`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_multi_vector.MultiVectorRetriever.html) designed to do just this!

A lot of the complexity lies in how to create the multiple vectors per document.
This guide covers some of the common ways to create those vectors and use the `MultiVectorRetriever`.

Some methods to create multiple vectors per document include:

- smaller chunks: split a document into smaller chunks, and embed those (e.g. the [`ParentDocumentRetriever`](/docs/how_to/parent_document_retriever))
- summary: create a summary for each document, embed that along with (or instead of) the document
- hypothetical questions: create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer, embed those along with (or instead of) the document

Note that this also enables another method of adding embeddings - manually. This is great because you can explicitly add questions or queries that should lead to a document being recovered, giving you more control.

## Smaller chunks

Often times it can be useful to retrieve larger chunks of information, but embed smaller chunks.
This allows for embeddings to capture the semantic meaning as closely as possible, but for as much context as possible to be passed downstream.
NOTE: this is what the ParentDocumentRetriever does. Here we show what is going on under the hood.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import SmallChunksExample from "@examples/retrievers/multi_vector_small_chunks.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SmallChunksExample}</CodeBlock>

## Summary

Oftentimes a summary may be able to distill more accurately what a chunk is about, leading to better retrieval.
Here we show how to create summaries, and then embed those.

import SummaryExample from "@examples/retrievers/multi_vector_summary.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SummaryExample}</CodeBlock>

## Hypothetical queries

An LLM can also be used to generate a list of hypothetical questions that could be asked of a particular document.
These questions can then be embedded and used to retrieve the original document:

import HypotheticalExample from "@examples/retrievers/multi_vector_hypothetical.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{HypotheticalExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned a few ways to generate multiple embeddings per document.

Next, check out the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers, the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

While some model providers support [built-in ways to return structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output), not all do. For these providers, you must use prompting to encourage the model to return structured data in the desired format.\n",

 "LangChain has [output parsers](/docs/concepts/output_parsers) which can help parse model outputs into usable objects. We'll go over a few examples below.\n",

 "The primary type of output parser for working with structured data in model responses is the [`StructuredOutputParser`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.output_parsers.StructuredOutputParser.html). In the below example, we define a schema for the type of output we expect from the model using [`zod`](https://zod.dev).\n",

# How to invoke runnables in parallel

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)

:::

The [`RunnableParallel`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.RunnableParallel.html) (also known as a `RunnableMap`) primitive is an object whose values are runnables (or things that can be coerced to runnables, like functions).
It runs all of its values in parallel, and each value is called with the initial input to the `RunnableParallel`. The final return value is an object with the results of each value under its appropriate key.

## Formatting with `RunnableParallels`

`RunnableParallels` are useful for parallelizing operations, but can also be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence. You can use them to split or fork the chain so that multiple components can process the input in parallel. Later, other components can join or merge the results to synthesize a final response. This type of chain creates a computation graph that looks like the following:

```text
 Input
 / \
 / \
 Branch1 Branch2
 \ /
 \ /
 Combine
```

Below, the input to each chain in the `RunnableParallel` is expected to be an object with a key for `"topic"`.
We can satisfy that requirement by invoking our chain with an object matching that structure.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/cohere @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import BasicExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/runnable_maps_basic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

## Manipulating outputs/inputs

Maps can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence.

Note below that the object within the `RunnableSequence.from()` call is automatically coerced into a runnable map. All keys of the object must
have values that are runnables or can be themselves coerced to runnables (functions to `RunnableLambda`s or objects to `RunnableMap`s).
This coercion will also occur when composing chains via the `.pipe()` method.

import SequenceExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/runnable_maps_sequence.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SequenceExample}</CodeBlock>

Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys "context" and "question". The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the "question" key.

## Next steps

You now know some ways to format and parallelize chain steps with `RunnableParallel`.

Next, you might be interested in [using custom logic](/docs/how_to/functions/) in your chains.

# How to retrieve the whole document for a chunk

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag)

:::

When splitting documents for retrieval, there are often conflicting desires:

1. You may want to have small documents, so that their embeddings can most accurately reflect their meaning. If documents are too long, then the embeddings can lose meaning.
2. You want to have long enough documents that the context of each chunk is retained.

The [`ParentDocumentRetriever`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_parent_document.ParentDocumentRetriever.html) strikes that balance by splitting and storing small chunks of data. During retrieval, it first fetches the small chunks but then looks up the parent ids for those chunks and returns those larger documents.

Note that "parent document" refers to the document that a small chunk originated from. This can either be the whole raw document OR a larger chunk.

This is a more specific form of [generating multiple embeddings per document](/docs/how_to/multi_vector).

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## With Score Threshold

By setting the options in `scoreThresholdOptions` we can force the `ParentDocumentRetriever` to use the `ScoreThresholdRetriever` under the hood.
This sets the vector store inside `ScoreThresholdRetriever` as the one we passed when initializing `ParentDocumentRetriever`, while also allowing us to also set a score threshold for the retriever.

This can be helpful when you're not sure how many documents you want (or if you are sure, just set the `maxK` option), but you want to make sure that the documents you do get are within a certain relevancy threshold.

Note: if a retriever is passed, `ParentDocumentRetriever` will default to use it for retrieving small chunks, as well as adding documents via the `addDocuments` method.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleWithScoreThreshold}</CodeBlock>

## With Contextual chunk headers

Consider a scenario where you want to store collection of documents in a vector store and perform Q&A tasks on them. Simply splitting documents with overlapping text may not provide sufficient context for LLMs to determine if multiple chunks are referencing the same information, or how to resolve information from contradictory sources.

Tagging each document with metadata is a solution if you know what to filter against, but you may not know ahead of time exactly what kind of queries your vector store will be expected to handle. Including additional contextual information directly in each chunk in the form of headers can help deal with arbitrary queries.

This is particularly important if you have several fine-grained child chunks that need to be correctly retrieved from the vector store.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleWithChunkHeader}</CodeBlock>

## With Reranking

With many documents from the vector store that are passed to LLM, final answers sometimes consist of information from
irrelevant chunks, making it less precise and sometimes incorrect. Also, passing multiple irrelevant documents makes it
more expensive.
So there are two reasons to use rerank - precision and costs.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleWithRerank}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned how to use the `ParentDocumentRetriever`.

Next, check out the more general form of [generating multiple embeddings per document](/docs/how_to/multi_vector), the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

# How to partially format prompt templates

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)

:::

Like partially binding arguments to a function, it can make sense to "partial" a prompt template - e.g. pass in
a subset of the required values, as to create a new prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.

LangChain supports this in two ways:

1. Partial formatting with string values.
2. Partial formatting with functions that return string values.

In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain.

## Partial with strings

One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get access to some of the variables in a
prompt before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, `foo` and `baz`.
If you get the `foo` value early on in your chain, but the `baz` value later, it can be inconvenient to pass both variables all the way through the chain.
Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the `foo` value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that.
Below is an example of doing this:

```typescript
import { PromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const prompt = new PromptTemplate({
 template: "{foo}{bar}",
 inputVariables: ["foo", "bar"],
});

const partialPrompt = await prompt.partial({
 foo: "foo",
});

const formattedPrompt = await partialPrompt.format({
 bar: "baz",
});

console.log(formattedPrompt);

// foobaz
```

You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables.

```typescript
const prompt = new PromptTemplate({
 template: "{foo}{bar}",
 inputVariables: ["bar"],
 partialVariables: {
 foo: "foo",
 },
});

const formattedPrompt = await prompt.format({
 bar: "baz",
});

console.log(formattedPrompt);

// foobaz
```

## Partial With Functions

You can also partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables can be tedious. In this case, it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.

```typescript
const getCurrentDate = () => {
 return new Date().toISOString();
};

const prompt = new PromptTemplate({
 template: "Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}",
 inputVariables: ["adjective", "date"],
});

const partialPrompt = await prompt.partial({
 date: getCurrentDate,
});

const formattedPrompt = await partialPrompt.format({
 adjective: "funny",
});

console.log(formattedPrompt);

// Tell me a funny joke about the day 2023-07-13T00:54:59.287Z
```

You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables:

```typescript
const prompt = new PromptTemplate({
 template: "Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}",
 inputVariables: ["adjective"],
 partialVariables: {
 date: getCurrentDate,
 },
});

const formattedPrompt = await prompt.format({
 adjective: "funny",
});

console.log(formattedPrompt);

// Tell me a funny joke about the day 2023-07-13T00:54:59.287Z
```

## Next steps

You've now learned how to partially apply variables to your prompt templates.

Next, check out the other how-to guides on prompt templates in this section, like [adding few-shot examples to your prompt templates](/docs/how_to/few_shot_examples_chat).

 "\n",
 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "This tutorial previously built a chatbot using [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html). You can access this version of the tutorial in the [v0.2 docs](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to/).\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangGraph implementation offers a number of advantages over `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, including the ability to persist arbitrary components of an application's state (instead of only messages).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\n",
 "\n",
 "In this guide we focus on **adding logic for incorporating historical messages.**\n",
 "\n",
 "This is largely a condensed version of the [Conversational RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history).\n",
 "\n",
 "We will cover two approaches:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. [Chains](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#chains), in which we always execute a retrieval step;\n",
 "2. [Agents](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#agents), in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).\n",
 "\n",
 "For the external knowledge source, we will use the same [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng from the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag)."

 " \"content\": \"**Task Decomposition** involves breaking down a complicated or large task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Here are some insights based on current techniques and research:\\n\\n1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**:\\n - Introduced by Wei et al.

(2023).\\n - Decomposes problems into multiple thought steps and generates several possibilities at each step.\\n - Utilizes tree structures through BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) with evaluation by a classifier or majority vote.\\n\\n3. **Methods of Task Decomposition**:\\n - **Simple Prompting**: Asking the model directly, e.g., \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\" or \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\".\\n - **Task-Specific Instructions**: Tailoring instructions to the task, such as \\\"Write a story outline\\\" for writing a novel.\\n - **Human Inputs**: Receiving inputs from humans to refine the process.\\n\\n4. **LLM+P Approach**:\\n - Suggested by Liu et al.

Translates the PDDL plan back into natural language.\\n - This method offloads the planning complexity to a specialized tool, especially relevant for domains utilizing robotic setups.\\n\\nTask Decomposition is a fundamental component of planning in autonomous agent systems, aiding in the efficient accomplishment of complex tasks by breaking them into smaller, actionable steps.\",\n",

In December 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[25]\\nThe cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.[160]\\nIn Asia\\nIn 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation, UNDP and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey.[161][162] Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.[47][60][122]\\nCheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.[66] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day.[123] Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon.[61][86] The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.[2][87]\\nSpeed and acceleration\\nThe cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.[88][89][90][91][92] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[60][63] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.[93] The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull.[60][65] A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah's claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.[77]\\nThe cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.2.1.\",\n",

In December 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[25]\\nThe cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.[160]\\nIn Asia\\nIn 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation, UNDP and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey.[161][162] Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.[47][60][122]\\nCheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.[66] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day.[123] Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon.[61][86] The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.[2][87]\\nSpeed and acceleration\\nThe cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.[88][89][90][91][92] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[60][63] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.[93] The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull.[60][65] A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah's claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.[77]\\nThe cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.2.1.\",\n",

 "context: [{\"pageContent\":\"Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure.

This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem.

Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",\"loc\":{\"lines\":{\"from\":182,\"to\":184}}}},{\"pageContent\":\"Agent System Overview\\n \\n Component One: Planning\\n \\n \\n Task Decomposition\\n \\n Self-Reflection\\n \\n \\n Component Two: Memory\\n \\n \\n Types of Memory\\n \\n Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)\\n \\n \\n Component Three: Tool Use\\n \\n Case Studies\\n \\n \\n Scientific Discovery Agent\\n \\n Generative Agents Simulation\\n \\n Proof-of-Concept Examples\\n \\n \\n Challenges\\n \\n Citation\\n \\n References\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",\"loc\":{\"lines\":{\"from\":112,\"to\":146}}}},{\"pageContent\":\"(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results.

 "# How to deal with high cardinality categorical variables\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Query analysis](/docs/tutorials/rag#query-analysis)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "High cardinality data refers to columns in a dataset that contain a large number of unique values. This guide demonstrates some techniques for dealing with these inputs.\n",
 "\n",
 "For example, you may want to do query analysis to create a filter on a categorical column. One of the difficulties here is that you usually need to specify the EXACT categorical value. The issue is you need to make sure the LLM generates that categorical value exactly. This can be done relatively easy with prompting when there are only a few values that are valid. When there are a high number of valid values then it becomes more difficult, as those values may not fit in the LLM context, or (if they do) there may be too many for the LLM to properly attend to.\n",
 "\n",
 "In this notebook we take a look at how to approach this."

# How to reduce retrieval latency

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)
- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag)

:::

One way to reduce retrieval latency is through a technique called "Adaptive Retrieval".
The [`MatryoshkaRetriever`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_matryoshka_retriever.MatryoshkaRetriever.html) uses the
Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) technique to retrieve documents for a given query in two steps:

- **First-pass**: Uses a lower dimensional sub-vector from the MRL embedding for an initial, fast,
 but less accurate search.

- **Second-pass**: Re-ranks the top results from the first pass using the full, high-dimensional
 embedding for higher accuracy.

![Matryoshka Retriever](/img/adaptive_retrieval.png)

It is based on this [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) blog post
["Matryoshka embeddings: faster OpenAI vector search using Adaptive Retrieval"](https://supabase.com/blog/matryoshka-embeddings).

### Setup

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

To follow the example below, you need an OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

We'll also be using `chroma` for our vector store. Follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma) to setup.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/matryoshka_retriever.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Due to the constraints of some vector stores, the large embedding metadata field is stringified (`JSON.stringify`) before being stored. This means that the metadata field will need to be parsed (`JSON.parse`) when retrieved from the vector store.
:::

## Next steps

You've now learned a technique that can help speed up your retrieval queries.

Next, check out the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

# How to route execution within a chain

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Configuring chain parameters at runtime](/docs/how_to/binding)
- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)
- [Chat Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)

:::

This guide covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.

There are two ways to perform routing:

1. Conditionally return runnables from a [`RunnableLambda`](/docs/how_to/functions) (recommended)
2. Using a `RunnableBranch` (legacy)

We'll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about LangChain, Anthropic, or Other, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain.

## Using a custom function

You can use a custom function to route between different outputs. Here's an example:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/core
```

import FactoryFunctionExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/how_to_routing_custom_function.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FactoryFunctionExample}</CodeBlock>

## Routing by semantic similarity

One especially useful technique is to use embeddings to route a query to the most relevant prompt. Here's an example:

import SemanticSimilarityExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/how_to_routing_semantic_similarity.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SemanticSimilarityExample}</CodeBlock>

## Using a RunnableBranch

A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it's invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input.

If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable.

Here's an example of what it looks like in action:

import BranchExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/how_to_routing_runnable_branch.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BranchExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned how to add routing to your composed LCEL chains.

Next, check out the other [how-to guides on runnables](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language) in this section.

This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\n",

 "# How to chain runnables\n",
 "\n",
 "One point about [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel) is that any two runnables can be \"chained\" together into sequences. The output of the previous runnable's `.invoke()` call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the `.pipe()` method.\n",
 "\n",
 "The resulting [`RunnableSequence`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.RunnableSequence.html) is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or further chained just like any other runnable. Advantages of chaining runnables in this way are efficient streaming (the sequence will stream output as soon as it is available), and debugging and tracing with tools like [LangSmith](/docs/how_to/debugging).\n",

# How to deal with large databases

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Question answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa)

:::

In order to write valid queries against a database, we need to feed the model the table names, table schemas, and feature values for it to query over.
When there are many tables, columns, and/or high-cardinality columns, it becomes impossible for us to dump the full information about our database in every prompt.
Instead, we must find ways to dynamically insert into the prompt only the most relevant information. Let's take a look at some techniques for doing this.

## Setup

First, install the required packages and set your environment variables. This example will use OpenAI as the LLM.

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai typeorm sqlite3
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your api key"
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow these [installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

- Save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) file as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Run sqlite3 `Chinook.db`
- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the Typeorm-driven `SqlDatabase` class:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DbCheck from "@examples/use_cases/sql/db_check.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DbCheck}</CodeBlock>

## Many tables

One of the main pieces of information we need to include in our prompt is the schemas of the relevant tables.
When we have very many tables, we can't fit all of the schemas in a single prompt.
What we can do in such cases is first extract the names of the tables related to the user input, and then include only their schemas.

One easy and reliable way to do this is using OpenAI function-calling and Zod models. LangChain comes with a built-in `createExtractionChainZod` chain that lets us do just this:

import LargeDbExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/large_db.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LargeDbExample}</CodeBlock>

We've seen how to dynamically include a subset of table schemas in a prompt within a chain.
Another possible approach to this problem is to let an Agent decide for itself when to look up tables by giving it a Tool to do so.

## High-cardinality columns

High-cardinality refers to columns in a database that have a vast range of unique values.
These columns are characterized by a high level of uniqueness in their data entries, such as individual names, addresses, or product serial numbers.
High-cardinality data can pose challenges for indexing and querying, as it requires more sophisticated strategies to efficiently filter and retrieve specific entries.

In order to filter columns that contain proper nouns such as addresses, song names or artists, we first need to double-check the spelling in order to filter the data correctly.

One naive strategy it to create a vector store with all the distinct proper nouns that exist in the database.
We can then query that vector store each user input and inject the most relevant proper nouns into the prompt.

First we need the unique values for each entity we want, for which we define a function that parses the result into a list of elements:

import HighCardinalityExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/large_db_high_cardinality.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{HighCardinalityExample}</CodeBlock>

We can see that with retrieval we're able to correct the spelling and get back a valid result.

Another possible approach to this problem is to let an Agent decide for itself when to look up proper nouns.

You've now learned about some prompting strategies to improve SQL generation.

# How to use prompting to improve results

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Question answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa)

:::

In this guide we'll go over prompting strategies to improve SQL query generation.
We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.

## Setup

First, install the required packages and set your environment variables. This example will use OpenAI as the LLM.

```bash
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/openai typeorm sqlite3
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your api key"
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow these [installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

- Save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) file as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Run sqlite3 `Chinook.db`
- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the Typeorm-driven `SqlDatabase` class:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DbCheck from "@examples/use_cases/sql/db_check.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DbCheck}</CodeBlock>

## Dialect-specific prompting

One of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using.
When using the built-in [`createSqlQueryChain`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chains_sql_db.createSqlQueryChain.html) and [`SqlDatabase`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.sql_db.SqlDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:

import DialectExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/prompting/list_dialects.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DialectExample}</CodeBlock>

## Table definitions and example rows

In basically any SQL chain, we'll need to feed the model at least part of the database schema.
Without this it won't be able to write valid queries. Our database comes with some convenience methods to give us the relevant context.
Specifically, we can get the table names, their schemas, and a sample of rows from each table:

import TableDefinitionsExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/prompting/table_definitions.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TableDefinitionsExample}</CodeBlock>

## Few-shot examples

Including examples of natural language questions being converted to valid SQL queries against our database in the prompt will often improve model performance, especially for complex queries.

Let's say we have the following examples:

import ExampleList from "@examples/use_cases/sql/prompting/examples.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleList}</CodeBlock>

We can create a few-shot prompt with them like so:

import FewShotExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/prompting/few_shot.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FewShotExample}</CodeBlock>

## Dynamic few-shot examples

If we have enough examples, we may want to only include the most relevant ones in the prompt, either because they don't fit in the model's context window or because the long tail of examples distracts the model.
And specifically, given any input we want to include the examples most relevant to that input.

We can do just this using an ExampleSelector. In this case we'll use a [`SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.example_selectors.SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.html),
which will store the examples in the vector database of our choosing.
At runtime it will perform a similarity search between the input and our examples, and return the most semantically similar ones:

import DynamicFewShotExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/prompting/dynamic_few_shot.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DynamicFewShotExample}</CodeBlock>

You've now learned about some prompting strategies to improve SQL generation.

# How to do query validation

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Question answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa)

:::

Perhaps the most error-prone part of any SQL chain or agent is writing valid and safe SQL queries.
In this guide we'll go over some strategies for validating our queries and handling invalid queries.

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/openai typeorm sqlite3
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your api key"
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow these [installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

- Save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) file as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Run sqlite3 `Chinook.db`
- Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
- Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the Typeorm-driven `SqlDatabase` class:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DbCheck from "@examples/use_cases/sql/db_check.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DbCheck}</CodeBlock>

## Query checker

Perhaps the simplest strategy is to ask the model itself to check the original query for common mistakes.
Suppose we have the following SQL query chain:

import FullExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/query_checking.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FullExample}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned about some strategies to validate generated SQL queries.

# How to stream agent data to the client

This guide will walk you through how we stream agent data to the client using [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) inside this directory.
The code in this doc is taken from the `page.tsx` and `action.ts` files in this directory. To view the full, uninterrupted code, click [here for the actions file](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/main/app/ai_sdk/agent/action.ts)
and [here for the client file](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/main/app/ai_sdk/agent/page.tsx).

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)
- [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)

:::

## Setup

First, install the necessary LangChain & AI SDK packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install langchain @langchain/core @langchain/community ai
```

In this demo we'll be using the `TavilySearchResults` tool, which requires an API key. You can get one [here](https://app.tavily.com/), or you can swap it out for another tool of your choice, like
[`WikipediaQueryRun`](/docs/integrations/tools/wikipedia) which doesn't require an API key.

If you choose to use `TavilySearchResults`, set your API key like so:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Get started

The first step is to create a new RSC file, and add the imports which we'll use for running our agent. In this demo, we'll name it `action.ts`:

```typescript action.ts
"use server";

import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { TavilySearchResults } from "@langchain/community/tools/tavily_search";
import { AgentExecutor, createToolCallingAgent } from "langchain/agents";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";
import { createStreamableValue } from "ai/rsc";
```

Next, we'll define a `runAgent` function. This function takes in a single input of `string`, and contains all the logic for our agent and streaming data back to the client:

```typescript action.ts
export async function runAgent(input: string) {
 "use server";
}
```

Next, inside our function we'll define our chat model of choice:

```typescript action.ts
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
 temperature: 0,
});
```

Next, we'll use the `createStreamableValue` helper function provided by the `ai` package to create a streamable value:

```typescript action.ts
const stream = createStreamableValue();
```

This will be very important later on when we start streaming data back to the client.

Next, lets define our async function inside which contains the agent logic:

```typescript action.ts
 (async () => {
 const tools = [new TavilySearchResults({ maxResults: 1 })];

 const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>(
 "hwchase17/openai-tools-agent",
 );

 const agent = createToolCallingAgent({
 llm,
 tools,
 prompt,
 });

 const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
 agent,
 tools,
 });
```

:::tip
As of `langchain` version `0.2.8`, the `createToolCallingAgent` function now supports [OpenAI-formatted tools](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core.language_models_base.ToolDefinition.html).
:::

Here you can see we're doing a few things:

The first is we're defining our list of tools (in this case we're only using a single tool) and pulling in our prompt from the LangChain prompt hub.

After that, we're passing our LLM, tools and prompt to the `createToolCallingAgent` function, which will construct and return a runnable agent.
This is then passed into the `AgentExecutor` class, which will handle the execution & streaming of our agent.

Finally, we'll call `.streamEvents` and pass our streamed data back to the `stream` variable we defined above,

```typescript action.ts
 const streamingEvents = agentExecutor.streamEvents(
 { input },
 { version: "v2" },
 );

 for await (const item of streamingEvents) {
 stream.update(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(item, null, 2)));
 }

 stream.done();
 })();
```

As you can see above, we're doing something a little wacky by stringifying and parsing our data. This is due to a bug in the RSC streaming code,
however if you stringify and parse like we are above, you shouldn't experience this.

Finally, at the bottom of the function return the stream value:

```typescript action.ts
return { streamData: stream.value };
```

Once we've implemented our server action, we can add a couple lines of code in our client function to request and stream this data:

First, add the necessary imports:

```typescript page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { readStreamableValue } from "ai/rsc";
import { runAgent } from "./action";
```

Then inside our `Page` function, calling the `runAgent` function is straightforward:

```typescript page.tsx
export default function Page() {
 const [input, setInput] = useState("");
 const [data, setData] = useState<StreamEvent[]>([]);

 async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {
 e.preventDefault();

 const { streamData } = await runAgent(input);
 for await (const item of readStreamableValue(streamData)) {
 setData((prev) => [...prev, item]);
 }
 }
}
```

That's it! You've successfully built an agent that streams data back to the client. You can now run your application and see the data streaming in real-time.
```

# How to stream structured output to the client

This guide will walk you through how we stream agent data to the client using [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) inside this directory.
The code in this doc is taken from the `page.tsx` and `action.ts` files in this directory. To view the full, uninterrupted code, click [here for the actions file](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/main/app/ai_sdk/tools/action.ts)
and [here for the client file](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template/blob/main/app/ai_sdk/tools/page.tsx).

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

> - [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel)
> - [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
> - [Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)

:::

## Setup

First, install the necessary LangChain & AI SDK packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core ai zod zod-to-json-schema
```

Next, we'll create our server file.
This will contain all the logic for making tool calls and sending the data back to the client.

Start by adding the necessary imports & the `"use server"` directive:

```typescript
"use server";

import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { createStreamableValue } from "ai/rsc";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";
import { JsonOutputKeyToolsParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers/openai_tools";
```

After that, we'll define our tool schema. For this example we'll use a simple demo weather schema:

```typescript
const Weather = z
 .object({
 city: z.string().describe("City to search for weather"),
 state: z.string().describe("State abbreviation to search for weather"),
 })
 .describe("Weather search parameters");
```

Once our schema is defined, we can implement our `executeTool` function.
This function takes in a single input of `string`, and contains all the logic for our tool and streaming data back to the client:

```typescript
export async function executeTool(
 input: string,
) {
 "use server";

 const stream = createStreamableValue();
```

The `createStreamableValue` function is important as this is what we'll use for actually streaming all the data back to the client.

For the main logic, we'll wrap it in an async function. Start by defining our prompt and chat model:

```typescript
 (async () => {
 const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
 [
 "system",
 `You are a helpful assistant. Use the tools provided to best assist the user.`,
 ],
 ["human", "{input}"],
 ]);

 const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
 temperature: 0,
 });

```

After defining our chat model, we'll define our runnable chain using LCEL.

We start binding our `weather` tool we defined earlier to the model:

```typescript
const modelWithTools = llm.bind({
 tools: [
 {
 type: "function" as const,
 function: {
 name: "get_weather",
 description: Weather.description,
 parameters: zodToJsonSchema(Weather),
 },
 },
 ],
});
```

Next, we'll use LCEL to pipe each component together, starting with the prompt, then the model with tools, and finally the output parser:

```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(modelWithTools).pipe(
 new JsonOutputKeyToolsParser<z.infer<typeof Weather>>({
 keyName: "get_weather",
 zodSchema: Weather,
 })
);
```

Finally, we'll call `.stream` on our chain, and similarly to the [streaming agent](/docs/how_to/stream_agent_client)
example, we'll iterate over the stream and stringify + parse the data before updating the stream value:

```typescript
 const streamResult = await chain.stream({
 input,
 });

 for await (const item of streamResult) {
 stream.update(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(item, null, 2)));
 }

 stream.done();
 })();

 return { streamData: stream.value };
}
```
```

# How to stream responses from an LLM

All [`LLM`s](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.language_models_llms.BaseLLM.html) implement the [Runnable interface](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html), which comes with **default** implementations of standard runnable methods (i.e. `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, `astream`, `astream_events`).

The **default** streaming implementations provide an `AsyncGenerator` that yields a single value: the final output from the underlying chat model provider.

The ability to stream the output token-by-token depends on whether the provider has implemented proper streaming support.

See which [integrations support token-by-token streaming here](/docs/integrations/llms/).

:::{.callout-note}

The **default** implementation does **not** provide support for token-by-token streaming, but it ensures that the model can be swapped in for any other model as it supports the same standard interface.

:::

## Using `.stream()`

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

The easiest way to stream is to use the `.stream()` method. This returns an readable stream that you can also iterate over:

import StreamMethodExample from "@examples/models/llm/llm_streaming_stream_method.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamMethodExample}</CodeBlock>

For models that do not support streaming, the entire response will be returned as a single chunk.

## Using a callback handler

You can also use a [`CallbackHandler`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.callbacks_base.BaseCallbackHandler.html) like so:

import StreamingExample from "@examples/models/llm/llm_streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamingExample}</CodeBlock>

We still have access to the end `LLMResult` if using `generate`. However, `tokenUsage` may not be currently supported for all model providers when streaming.

 "# How to return structured data from a model\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"with_structured_output\"></span>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "It is often useful to have a model return output that matches some specific schema. One common use-case is extracting data from arbitrary text to insert into a traditional database or use with some other downstrem system. This guide will show you a few different strategies you can use to do this.\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "## The `.withStructuredOutput()` method\n",
 "\n",
 "There are several strategies that models can use under the hood. For some of the most popular model providers, including [Anthropic](/docs/integrations/platforms/anthropic/), [Google VertexAI](/docs/integrations/platforms/google/), [Mistral](/docs/integrations/chat/mistral/), and [OpenAI](/docs/integrations/platforms/openai/) LangChain implements a common interface that abstracts away these strategies called `.withStructuredOutput`.\n",
 "\n",
 "By invoking this method (and passing in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) or a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev/)) the model will add whatever model parameters + output parsers are necessary to get back structured output matching the requested schema. If the model supports more than one way to do this (e.g., function calling vs JSON mode) - you can configure which method to use by passing into that method.\n",
 "\n",
 "Let's look at some examples of this in action! We'll use Zod to create a simple response schema.\n",

# How to create a time-weighted retriever

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag)

:::

This guide covers the [`TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_time_weighted.TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever.html),
which uses a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay.

The algorithm for scoring them is:

```
semantic_similarity + (1.0 - decay_rate) ^ hours_passed
```

Notably, `hours_passed` refers to the hours passed since the object in the retriever **was last accessed**, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain "fresh."

```typescript
let score = (1.0 - this.decayRate) ** hoursPassed + vectorRelevance;
```

`this.decayRate` is a configurable decimal number between 0 and 1. A lower number means that documents will be "remembered" for longer, while a higher number strongly weights more recently accessed documents.

Note that setting a decay rate of exactly 0 or 1 makes `hoursPassed` irrelevant and makes this retriever equivalent to a standard vector lookup.

It is important to note that due to required metadata, all documents must be added to the backing vector store using the `addDocuments` method on the **retriever**, not the vector store itself.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/time-weighted-retriever.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Next steps

You've now learned how to use time as a factor when performing retrieval.

Next, check out the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

 "\n",
 "Tools are utilities that can be called by a model, and whose outputs are designed to be fed back to a model. Sometimes, however, there are artifacts of a tool's execution that we want to make accessible to downstream components in our chain or agent, but that we don't want to expose to the model itself.\n",
 "\n",
 "For example if a tool returns something like a custom object or an image, we may want to pass some metadata about this output to the model without passing the actual output to the model. At the same time, we may want to be able to access this full output elsewhere, for example in downstream tools.\n",
 "\n",
 "The Tool and [ToolMessage](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.messages_tool.ToolMessage.html) interfaces make it possible to distinguish between the parts of the tool output meant for the model (this is the `ToolMessage.content`) and those parts which are meant for use outside the model (`ToolMessage.artifact`).\n",

 "Some multimodal models, such as those that can reason over images or audio, support [tool calling](/docs/concepts/#tool-calling) features as well.\n",

 "To call tools using such models, simply bind tools to them in the [usual way](/docs/how_to/tool_calling), and invoke the model using content blocks of the desired type (e.g., containing image data).\n",
 "\n",
 "Below, we demonstrate examples using [OpenAI](/docs/integrations/platforms/openai) and [Anthropic](/docs/integrations/platforms/anthropic). We will use the same image and tool in all cases. Let's first select an image, and build a placeholder tool that expects as input the string \"sunny\", \"cloudy\", or \"rainy\". We will ask the models to describe the weather in the image.\n",

 "# How to stream events from a tool\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "- [LangChain Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)\n",
 "- [Custom tools](/docs/how_to/custom_tools)\n",
 "- [Using stream events](/docs/how_to/streaming/#using-stream-events)\n",
 "- [Accessing RunnableConfig within a custom tool](/docs/how_to/tool_configure/)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you have tools that call chat models, retrievers, or other runnables, you may want to access internal events from those runnables or configure them with additional properties. This guide shows you how to manually pass parameters properly so that you can do this using the [`.streamEvents()`](/docs/how_to/streaming/#using-stream-events) method.\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::caution Compatibility\n",
 "\n",
 "In order to support a wider variety of JavaScript environments, the base LangChain package does not automatically propagate configuration to child runnables by default. This includes callbacks necessary for `.streamEvents()`. This is a common reason why you may fail to see events being emitted from custom runnables or tools.\n",
 "\n",
 "You will need to manually propagate the `RunnableConfig` object to the child runnable. For an example of how to manually propagate the config, see the implementation of the `bar` RunnableLambda below.\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide also requires `@langchain/core>=0.2.16`.\n",
 ":::\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "Say you have a custom tool that calls a chain that condenses its input by prompting a chat model to return only 10 words, then reversing the output. First, define it in a naive way:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import ChatModelTabs from \"@theme/ChatModelTabs\";\n",

 "# How to use LangChain tools\n",
 "\n",
 "Tools are interfaces that an agent, chain, or LLM can use to interact with the world.\n",
 "They combine a few things:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. The name of the tool\n",
 "2. A description of what the tool is\n",
 "3. JSON schema of what the inputs to the tool are\n",
 "4. The function to call \n",
 "5. Whether the result of a tool should be returned directly to the user\n",
 "\n",
 "It is useful to have all this information because this information can be used to build action-taking systems! The name, description, and schema can be used to prompt the LLM so it knows how to specify what action to take, and then the function to call is equivalent to taking that action.\n",
 "\n",
 "The simpler the input to a tool is, the easier it is for an LLM to be able to use it.\n",
 "Many agents will only work with tools that have a single string input.\n",
 "\n",
 "Importantly, the name, description, and schema (if used) are all used in the prompt. Therefore, it is vitally important that they are clear and describe exactly how the tool should be used.\n",

 "# How to trim messages\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)\n",
 "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
 "- [Chaining](/docs/how_to/sequence/)\n",
 "- [Chat history](/docs/concepts/chat_history)\n",
 "\n",
 "The methods in this guide also require `@langchain/core>=0.2.8`.\n",
 "Please see here for a [guide on upgrading](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "All models have finite context windows, meaning there's a limit to how many tokens they can take as input. If you have very long messages or a chain/agent that accumulates a long message is history, you'll need to manage the length of the messages you're passing in to the model.\n",
 "\n",
 "The `trimMessages` util provides some basic strategies for trimming a list of messages to be of a certain token length.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Getting the last `maxTokens` tokens\n",
 "\n",
 "To get the last `maxTokens` in the list of Messages we can set `strategy: \"last\"`. Notice that for our `tokenCounter` we can pass in a function (more on that below) or a language model (since language models have a message token counting method). It makes sense to pass in a model when you're trimming your messages to fit into the context window of that specific model:"

# How use a vector store to retrieve data

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)
- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)
- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)

:::

Vector stores can be converted into retrievers using the [`.asRetriever()`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html#asRetriever) method, which allows you to more easily compose them in chains.

Below, we show a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chain that performs question answering over documents using the following steps:

1. Initialize an vector store
2. Create a retriever from that vector store
3. Compose a question answering chain
4. Ask questions!

Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations, but we'll go through one common flow.
First, install the required dependency:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

You can download the `state_of_the_union.txt` file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt).

import RetrievalQAExample from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalQAExample}</CodeBlock>

Let's walk through what's happening here.

1. We first load a long text and split it into smaller documents using a text splitter.
 We then load those documents (which also embeds the documents using the passed `OpenAIEmbeddings` instance) into HNSWLib, our vector store, creating our index.

2. Though we can query the vector store directly, we convert the vector store into a retriever to return retrieved documents in the right format for the question answering chain.

3. We initialize a retrieval chain, which we'll call later in step 4.

4. We ask questions!

## Next steps

You've now learned how to convert a vector store as a retriever.

See the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers, the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).

# How to create and query vector stores

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores) for documentation on built-in integrations with vectorstore providers.
:::

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)
- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)
- [Document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders)

:::

One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding
vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are
'most similar' to the embedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search
for you.

This walkthrough uses a basic, unoptimized implementation called [`MemoryVectorStore`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.vectorstores_memory.MemoryVectorStore.html) that stores embeddings in-memory and does an exact, linear search for the most similar embeddings.
LangChain contains many built-in integrations - see [this section](/docs/how_to/vectorstores/#which-one-to-pick) for more, or the [full list of integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/).

## Creating a new index

Most of the time, you'll need to load and prepare the data you want to search over. Here's an example that loads a recent speech from a file:

import ExampleLoader from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/memory_fromdocs.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleLoader}</CodeBlock>

Most of the time, you'll need to split the loaded text as a preparation step. See [this section](/docs/concepts/text_splitters) to learn more about text splitters.

## Creating a new index from texts

If you have already prepared the data you want to search over, you can initialize a vector store directly from text chunks:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleTexts from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/memory.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleTexts}</CodeBlock>

## Which one to pick?

Here's a quick guide to help you pick the right vector store for your use case:

- If you're after something that can just run inside your Node.js application, in-memory, without any other servers to stand up, then go for [HNSWLib](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/hnswlib), [Faiss](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss), [LanceDB](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/lancedb) or [CloseVector](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/closevector)
- If you're looking for something that can run in-memory in browser-like environments, then go for [MemoryVectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/memory) or [CloseVector](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/closevector)
- If you come from Python and you were looking for something similar to FAISS, try [HNSWLib](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/hnswlib) or [Faiss](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss)
- If you're looking for an open-source full-featured vector database that you can run locally in a docker container, then go for [Chroma](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma)
- If you're looking for an open-source vector database that offers low-latency, local embedding of documents and supports apps on the edge, then go for [Zep](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/zep)
- If you're looking for an open-source production-ready vector database that you can run locally (in a docker container) or hosted in the cloud, then go for [Weaviate](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate).
- If you're using Supabase already then look at the [Supabase](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase) vector store to use the same Postgres database for your embeddings too
- If you're looking for a production-ready vector store you don't have to worry about hosting yourself, then go for [Pinecone](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone)
- If you are already utilizing SingleStore, or if you find yourself in need of a distributed, high-performance database, you might want to consider the [SingleStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/singlestore) vector store.
- If you are looking for an online MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) data warehousing service, you might want to consider the [AnalyticDB](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/analyticdb) vector store.
- If you're in search of a cost-effective vector database that allows run vector search with SQL, look no further than [MyScale](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/myscale).
- If you're in search of a vector database that you can load from both the browser and server side, check out [CloseVector](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/closevector). It's a vector database that aims to be cross-platform.
- If you're looking for a scalable, open-source columnar database with excellent performance for analytical queries, then consider [ClickHouse](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/clickhouse).

# Upstash Ratelimit Callback

In this guide, we will go over how to add rate limiting based on number of requests or the number of tokens using `UpstashRatelimitHandler`. This handler uses [Upstash's ratelimit library](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit-js/), which utilizes [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted).

Upstash Ratelimit works by sending an HTTP request to Upstash Redis every time the `limit` method is called. Remaining tokens/requests of the user are checked and updated. Based on the remaining tokens, we can stop the execution of costly operations, like invoking an LLM or querying a vector store:

```tsx
const response = await ratelimit.limit();
if (response.success) {
 execute_costly_operation();
}
```

`UpstashRatelimitHandler` allows you to incorporate this ratelimit logic into your chain in a few minutes.

## Setup

First, you will need to go to [the Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/login) and create a redis database ([see our docs](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted)). After creating a database, you will need to set the environment variables:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="****"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="****"
```

Next, you will need to install Upstash Ratelimit and `@langchain/community`:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @upstash/ratelimit @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You are now ready to add rate limiting to your chain!

## Ratelimiting Per Request

Let's imagine that we want to allow our users to invoke our chain 10 times per minute. Achieving this is as simple as:

```tsx
const UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL = "****";
const UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN = "****";

import {
 UpstashRatelimitHandler,
 UpstashRatelimitError,
} from "@langchain/community/callbacks/handlers/upstash_ratelimit";
import { RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

// create ratelimit
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
 redis: new Redis({
 url: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
 token: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
 }),
 // 10 requests per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
 limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(10, "60 s"),
});

// create handler
const user_id = "user_id"; // should be a method which gets the user id
const handler = new UpstashRatelimitHandler(user_id, {
 requestRatelimit: ratelimit,
});

// create mock chain
const chain = new RunnableLambda({ func: (str: string): string => str });

try {
 const response = await chain.invoke("hello world", {
 callbacks: [handler],
 });
 console.log(response);
} catch (err) {
 if (err instanceof UpstashRatelimitError) {
 console.log("Handling ratelimit.");
 }
}
```

Note that we pass the handler to the `invoke` method instead of passing the handler when defining the chain.

For rate limiting algorithms other than `FixedWindow`, see [upstash-ratelimit docs](https://upstash.com/docs/oss/sdks/ts/ratelimit/algorithms).

Before executing any steps in our pipeline, ratelimit will check whether the user has passed the request limit. If so, `UpstashRatelimitError` is raised.

## Ratelimiting Per Token

Another option is to rate limit chain invokations based on:

1. number of tokens in prompt
2. number of tokens in prompt and LLM completion

This only works if you have an LLM in your chain. Another requirement is that the LLM you are using should return the token usage in it's `LLMOutput`. The format of the token usage dictionary returned depends on the LLM. To learn about how you should configure the handler depending on your LLM, see the end of the Configuration section below.

### How it works

The handler will get the remaining tokens before calling the LLM. If the remaining tokens is more than 0, LLM will be called. Otherwise `UpstashRatelimitError` will be raised.

After LLM is called, token usage information will be used to subtracted from the remaining tokens of the user. No error is raised at this stage of the chain.

### Configuration

For the first configuration, simply initialize the handler like this:

```tsx
const user_id = "user_id"; // should be a method which gets the user id
const handler = new UpstashRatelimitHandler(user_id, {
 requestRatelimit: ratelimit,
});
```

For the second configuration, here is how to initialize the handler:

```tsx
const user_id = "user_id"; // should be a method which gets the user id
const handler = new UpstashRatelimitHandler(user_id, {
 tokenRatelimit: ratelimit,
});
```

You can also employ ratelimiting based on requests and tokens at the same time, simply by passing both `request_ratelimit` and `token_ratelimit` parameters.

For token usage to work correctly, the LLM step in LangChain.js should return a token usage field in the following format:

```json
{
 "tokenUsage": {
 "totalTokens": 123,
 "promptTokens": 456,
 "otherFields: "..."
 },
 "otherFields: "..."
}
```

Not all LLMs in LangChain.js comply with this format however. If your LLM returns the same values with different keys, you can use the parameters `llmOutputTokenUsageField`, `llmOutputTotalTokenField` and `llmOutputPromptTokenField` by passing them to the handler:

```tsx
const handler = new UpstashRatelimitHandler(
 user_id,
 {
 requestRatelimit: ratelimit
 llmOutputTokenUsageField: "usage",
 llmOutputTotalTokenField: "total",
 llmOutputPromptTokenField: "prompt"
 }
)
```

Here is an example with a chain utilizing an LLM:

```tsx
const UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL = "****";
const UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN = "****";
const OPENAI_API_KEY = "****";

import {
 UpstashRatelimitHandler,
 UpstashRatelimitError,
} from "@langchain/community/callbacks/handlers/upstash_ratelimit";
import { RunnableLambda, RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

// create ratelimit
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
 redis: new Redis({
 url: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
 token: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
 }),
 // 500 tokens per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
 limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(500, "60 s"),
});

// create handler
const user_id = "user_id"; // should be a method which gets the user id
const handler = new UpstashRatelimitHandler(user_id, {
 tokenRatelimit: ratelimit,
});

// create mock chain
const asStr = new RunnableLambda({ func: (str: string): string => str });
const model = new OpenAI({
 apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const chain = RunnableSequence.from([asStr, model]);

// invoke chain with handler:
try {
 const response = await chain.invoke("hello world", {
 callbacks: [handler],
 });
 console.log(response);

# ChatAlibabaTongyi

LangChain.js supports the Alibaba qwen family of models.

## Setup

You'll need to sign up for an Alibaba API key and set it as an environment variable named `ALIBABA_API_KEY`.

Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

Here's an example:

import Tongyi from "@examples/models/chat/integration_alitongyi.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Tongyi}</CodeBlock>

This is why the sky appears even darker blue when looking towards the horizon.\\n\\nSo in essence, the selective scattering of the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight by the gases in the atmosphere is what causes the sky to appear blue to our eyes during the daytime.\",\n",

 "\n",
 "Language models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text).\n",
 "These are generally newer models (older models are generally \\`LLMs\\`, see below).\n",
 "Chat models support the assignment of distinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from the AI, users, and instructions such as system messages.\n",
 "\n",
 "Although the underlying models are messages in, message out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take a string as input.\n",
 "This gives them the same interface as LLMs (and simpler to use).\n",
 "When a string is passed in as input, it will be converted to a \\`HumanMessage\\` under the hood before being passed to the underlying model.\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations.\n",

 "We have some standardized parameters when constructing ChatModels:\n",

 "Chat Models also accept other parameters that are specific to that integration.\n",

 "#### Multimodality\n",
 "\n",
 "Some chat models are multimodal, accepting images, audio and even video as inputs.\n",
 "These are still less common, meaning model providers haven't standardized on the \"best\" way to define the API.\n",
 "Multimodal outputs are even less common. As such, we've kept our multimodal abstractions fairly light weight\n",
 "and plan to further solidify the multimodal APIs and interaction patterns as the field matures.\n",
 "\n",
 "In LangChain, most chat models that support multimodal inputs also accept those values in OpenAI's content blocks format.\n",
 "So far this is restricted to image inputs. For models like Gemini which support video and other bytes input, the APIs also support the native, model-specific representations.\n",

 "- A List of objects (this is used for multi-modal input, where the object contains information about that input type and that input location)\n",
 "\n",
 "#### HumanMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a message from the user.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### AIMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a message from the model. In addition to the \\`content\\` property, these messages also have:\n",
 "\n",
 "**\\`response_metadata\\`**\n",
 "\n",
 "The \\`response_metadata\\` property contains additional metadata about the response. The data here is often specific to each model provider.\n",
 "This is where information like log-probs and token usage may be stored.\n",
 "\n",
 "**\\`tool_calls\\`**\n",
 "\n",
 "These represent a decision from an language model to call a tool. They are included as part of an \\`AIMessage\\` output.\n",
 "They can be accessed from there with the \\`.tool_calls\\` property.\n",
 "\n",
 "This property returns a list of \\`ToolCall\\`s. A \\`ToolCall\\` is an object with the following arguments:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \\`name\\`: The name of the tool that should be called.\n",
 "- \\`args\\`: The arguments to that tool.\n",
 "- \\`id\\`: The id of that tool call.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### SystemMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a system message, which tells the model how to behave. Not every model provider supports this.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### ToolMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents the result of a tool call. In addition to \\`role\\` and \\`content\\`, this message has:\n",
 "\n",
 "- a \\`tool_call_id\\` field which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.\n",
 "- an \\`artifact\\` field which can be used to pass along arbitrary artifacts of the tool execution which are useful to track but which should not be sent to the model.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### (Legacy) FunctionMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This is a legacy message type, corresponding to OpenAI's legacy function-calling API. \\`ToolMessage\\` should be used instead to correspond to the updated tool-calling API.\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents the result of a function call. In addition to \\`role\\` and \\`content\\`, this message has a \\`name\\` parameter which conveys the name of the function that was called to produce this result.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Prompt templates\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"prompt,prompttemplate,chatprompttemplate\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model.\n",
 "This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt Templates take as input an object, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or an array of messages.\n",
 "The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.\n",
 "\n",
 "There are a few different types of prompt templates:\n",
 "\n",
 "#### String PromptTemplates\n",
 "\n",
 "These prompt templates are used to format a single string, and generally are used for simpler inputs.\n",
 "For example, a common way to construct and use a PromptTemplate is as follows:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import { PromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(\n",
 " \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\"\n",
 ");\n",
 "\n",
 "await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: \"cats\" });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "#### ChatPromptTemplates\n",
 "\n",
 "These prompt templates are used to format an array of messages. These \"templates\" consist of an array of templates themselves.\n",
 "For example, a common way to construct and use a ChatPromptTemplate is as follows:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import { ChatPromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " [\"user\", \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\"],\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\n",
 "await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: \"cats\" });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "In the above example, this ChatPromptTemplate will construct two messages when called.\n",
 "The first is a system message, that has no variables to format.\n",
 "The second is a HumanMessage, and will be formatted by the \\`topic\\` variable the user passes in.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### MessagesPlaceholder\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"messagesplaceholder\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 "This prompt template is responsible for adding an array of messages in a particular place.\n",
 "In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw how we could format two messages, each one a string.\n",
 "But what if we wanted the user to pass in an array of messages that we would slot into a particular spot?\n",
 "This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder.\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import {\n",
 " ChatPromptTemplate,\n",
 " MessagesPlaceholder,\n",
 "} from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "import { HumanMessage } from \"@langchain/core/messages\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " new MessagesPlaceholder(\"msgs\"),\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\n",
 "promptTemplate.invoke({ msgs: [new HumanMessage({ content: \"hi!\" })] });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "This will produce an array of two messages, the first one being a system message, and the second one being the HumanMessage we passed in.\n",
 "If we had passed in 5 messages, then it would have produced 6 messages in total (the system message plus the 5 passed in).\n",
 "This is useful for letting an array of messages be slotted into a particular spot.\n",
 "\n",
 "An alternative way to accomplish the same thing without using the \\`MessagesPlaceholder\\` class explicitly is:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " [\"placeholder\", \"{msgs}\"], // <-- This is the changed part\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use prompt templates, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#prompt-templates).\n",
 "\n",
 "### Example Selectors\n",
 "\n",
 "One common prompting technique for achieving better performance is to include examples as part of the prompt.\n",
 "This gives the language model concrete examples of how it should behave.\n",
 "Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for more advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them.\n",
 "Example Selectors are classes responsible for selecting and then formatting examples into prompts.\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use example selectors, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#example-selectors).\n",
 "\n",
 "### Output parsers\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"output parser\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "The information here refers to parsers that take a text output from a model try to parse it into a more structured representation.\n",
 "More and more models are supporting function (or tool) calling, which handles this automatically.\n",
 "It is recommended to use function/tool calling rather than output parsing.\n",
 "See documentation for that [here](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks.\n",
 "Useful when you are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.\n",
 "\n",
 "There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\n",
 "- \"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\n",
 "\n",
 "And then one optional one:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\n",
 "\n",
 "Output parsers accept a string or \\`BaseMessage\\` as input and can return an arbitrary type.\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain has many different types of output parsers. This is a list of output parsers LangChain supports. The table below has various pieces of information:\n",
 "\n",
 "**Name**: The name of the output parser\n",
 "\n",
 "**Supports Streaming**: Whether the output parser supports streaming.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Input Type**: Expected input type. Most output parsers work on both strings and messages, but some (like OpenAI Functions) need a message with specific arguments.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Output Type**: The output type of the object returned by the parser.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Description**: Our commentary on this output parser and when to use it.\n",

 "1. Install the new `@langchain/openai` package and remove the previous `@langchain/azure-openai` package:\n",

 "```\n",

 "```\n",

 " ```typescript\n",
 " import { AzureChatOpenAI } from \"@langchain/openai\";\n",
 " ```\n",
 "3. Update your code to use the new `AzureChatOpenAI` class and pass the required parameters:\n",

 " ```typescript\n",
 " const model = new AzureChatOpenAI({\n",
 " azureOpenAIApiKey: \"<your_key>\",\n",

 " - If you were using Azure Managed Identity, you now need to use the `azureADTokenProvider` parameter to the constructor instead of `credentials`, see the [Azure Managed Identity](#using-azure-managed-identity) section for more details.\n",
 "\n",
 " - If you were using environment variables, you now have to set the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME` environment variable instead of `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT`, and add the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` environment variable to specify the API version.\n"

 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "To access Bedrock models you'll need to create an AWS account, set up the Bedrock API service, get an access key ID and secret key, and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "Head to the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to sign up for AWS and setup your credentials. You'll also need to turn on model access for your account, which you can do by [following these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",

 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangChain `BedrockChat` integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package. You'll also need to install several official AWS packages as peer dependencies:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",

 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "You can also use BedrockChat in web environments such as Edge functions or Cloudflare Workers by omitting the @aws-sdk/credential-provider-node dependency and using the web entrypoint:\n",

# ChatDeepInfra

LangChain supports chat models hosted by [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com/) through the `ChatDeepInfra` wrapper.
First, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll need to obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable named `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`
(or pass it into the constructor), then call the model as shown below:

import Example from "@examples/models/chat/integration_deepinfra.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Fake LLM

LangChain provides a fake LLM chat model for testing purposes. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and and simulate what would happen if the LLM responded in a certain way.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import FakeListChatExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_fake.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FakeListChatExample}</CodeBlock>

# Friendli

> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `ChatFriendli` for chat applications using LangChain. `ChatFriendli` offers a flexible approach to generating conversational AI responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous calls.

## Setup

Ensure the `@langchain/community` is installed.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.
You can set team id as `FRIENDLI_TEAM` environment.

You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use. The default model is `meta-llama-3-8b-instruct`. You can check the available models at [docs.friendli.ai](https://docs.friendli.ai/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/models/chat/friendli.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain.js supports two different authentication methods based on whether\n",
 "you're running in a Node.js environment or a web environment.\n",
 "\n",
 "To access `ChatVertexAI` models you'll need to setup Google VertexAI in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, save the credentials file, and install the `@langchain/google-vertexai` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "Head to your [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and generate a credentials file. Once you've done this set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"path/to/your/credentials.json\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If running in a web environment, you should set the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable as a JSON stringified object, and install the `@langchain/google-vertexai-web` package:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS={\"type\":\"service_account\",\"project_id\":\"YOUR_PROJECT-12345\",...}\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangChain `ChatVertexAI` integration lives in the `@langchain/google-vertexai` package:\n",

# Chat models

[Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) are language models that use a sequence of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages) as inputs and return messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text). These are generally newer models.

:::info
If you'd like to write your own chat model, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/custom_chat). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).
:::

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs openaiParams={`{ model: "gpt-4o-mini" }`} />

```python
await model.invoke("Hello, world!")
```

# Llama CPP

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This module is based on the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) Node.js bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), allowing you to work with a locally running LLM. This allows you to work with a much smaller quantized model capable of running on a laptop environment, ideal for testing and scratch padding ideas without running up a bill!

## Setup

You'll need to install major version `3` of the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) module to communicate with your local model.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S node-llama-cpp@3 @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You will also need a local Llama 3 model (or a model supported by [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp)). You will need to pass the path to this model to the LlamaCpp module as a part of the parameters (see example).

Out-of-the-box `node-llama-cpp` is tuned for running on a MacOS platform with support for the Metal GPU of Apple M-series of processors. If you need to turn this off or need support for the CUDA architecture then refer to the documentation at [node-llama-cpp](https://withcatai.github.io/node-llama-cpp/).

For advice on getting and preparing `llama3` see the documentation for the LLM version of this module.

A note to LangChain.js contributors: if you want to run the tests associated with this module you will need to put the path to your local model in the environment variable `LLAMA_PATH`.

## Usage

### Basic use

In this case we pass in a prompt wrapped as a message and expect a response.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import BasicExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

### System messages

We can also provide a system message, note that with the `llama_cpp` module a system message will cause the creation of a new session.

import SystemExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp_system.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SystemExample}</CodeBlock>

### Chains

This module can also be used with chains, note that using more complex chains will require suitably powerful version of `llama3` such as the 70B version.

import ChainExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp_chain.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChainExample}</CodeBlock>

### Streaming

We can also stream with Llama CPP, this can be using a raw 'single prompt' string:

import StreamExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamExample}</CodeBlock>

Or you can provide multiple messages, note that this takes the input and then submits a Llama3 formatted prompt to the model.

import StreamMultiExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp_stream_multi.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamMultiExample}</CodeBlock>

Using the `invoke` method, we can also achieve stream generation, and use `signal` to abort the generation.

import StreamInvokeExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_llama_cpp_stream_invoke.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamInvokeExample}</CodeBlock>

To use Minimax models, you'll need a [Minimax account](https://api.minimax.chat), an [API key](https://api.minimax.chat/user-center/basic-information/interface-key), and a [Group ID](https://api.minimax.chat/user-center/basic-information)

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import UnifiedModelParamsTooltip from "@mdx_components/unified_model_params_tooltip.mdx";

<UnifiedModelParamsTooltip></UnifiedModelParamsTooltip>

## Basic usage

import Minimax from "@examples/models/chat/integration_minimax.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Minimax}</CodeBlock>

## Chain model calls

import MinimaxChain from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_chain.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxChain}</CodeBlock>

## With function calls

import MinimaxFunctions from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_functions.ts";
import MinimaxFunctionsZod from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_functions_zod.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxFunctions}</CodeBlock>

## Functions with Zod

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxFunctionsZod}</CodeBlock>

## With glyph

This feature can help users force the model to return content in the requested format.

import MinimaxGlyph from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_glyph.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxGlyph}</CodeBlock>

## With sample messages

This feature can help the model better understand the return information the user wants to get,
including but not limited to the content, format, and response mode of the information.

import MinimaxSampleMessages from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_sample_messages.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxSampleMessages}</CodeBlock>

## With plugins

This feature supports calling tools like a search engine to get additional data that can assist the model.

import MinimaxPlugins from "@examples/models/chat/minimax_plugins.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MinimaxPlugins}</CodeBlock>

# ChatMoonshot

LangChain.js supports the Moonshot AI family of models.

https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/intro

## Setup

You'll need to sign up for an Moonshot API key and set it as an environment variable named `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`

https://platform.moonshot.cn/console

You'll also need to install the following dependencies:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

Here's an example:

import Moonshot from "@examples/models/chat/integration_moonshot.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Moonshot}</CodeBlock>

# NIBittensorChatModel

:::warning
This module has been deprecated and is no longer supported. The documentation below will not work in versions 0.2.0 or later.
:::

LangChain.js offers experimental support for Neural Internet's Bittensor chat models.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { NIBittensorChatModel } from "langchain/experimental/chat_models/bittensor";
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const chat = new NIBittensorChatModel();
const message = new HumanMessage("What is bittensor?");
const res = await chat.invoke([message]);
console.log({ res });
/*
 {
 res: "\nBittensor is opensource protocol..."
 }
 */
```

# Ollama Functions

:::warning

The LangChain Ollama integration package has official support for tool calling. [Click here to view the documentation](/docs/integrations/chat/ollama#tools).

:::

LangChain offers an experimental wrapper around open source models run locally via [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)
that gives it the same API as OpenAI Functions.

Note that more powerful and capable models will perform better with complex schema and/or multiple functions. The examples below
use [Mistral](https://ollama.ai/library/mistral).

:::warning

This is an experimental wrapper that attempts to bolt-on tool calling support to models that do not natively support it. Use with caution.

:::

## Setup

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to set up and run a local Ollama instance.

## Initialize model

You can initialize this wrapper the same way you'd initialize a standard `ChatOllama` instance:

```typescript
import { OllamaFunctions } from "@langchain/community/experimental/chat_models/ollama_functions";

const model = new OllamaFunctions({
 temperature: 0.1,
 model: "mistral",
});
```

## Passing in functions

You can now pass in functions the same way as OpenAI:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import OllamaFunctionsCalling from "@examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/function_calling.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OllamaFunctionsCalling}</CodeBlock>

## Using for extraction

import OllamaFunctionsExtraction from "@examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/extraction.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OllamaFunctionsExtraction}</CodeBlock>

:::tip
You can see a simple LangSmith trace of this [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/74692bfc-0224-4221-b187-ddbf20d7ecc0/r)
:::

## Customization

Behind the scenes, this uses Ollama's JSON mode to constrain output to JSON, then passes tools schemas as JSON schema into the prompt.

Because different models have different strengths, it may be helpful to pass in your own system prompt. Here's an example:

import OllamaFunctionsCustomPrompt from "@examples/models/chat/ollama_functions/custom_prompt.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OllamaFunctionsCustomPrompt}</CodeBlock>

 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "To access OpenAI chat models you'll need to create an OpenAI account, get an API key, and install the `@langchain/openai` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "Head to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/) to sign up for OpenAI and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangChain `ChatOpenAI` integration lives in the `@langchain/openai` package:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "\n",
 "import IntegrationInstallTooltip from \"@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx\";\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from \"@theme/Npm2Yarn\";\n",

 "\n",
 "LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for various components useful for building with LLMs.\n",
 "Some components LangChain implements, some components we rely on third-party integrations for, and others are a mix.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Chat models\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"chat model,chat models\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 "Language models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text).\n",
 "These are generally newer models (older models are generally \\`LLMs\\`, see below).\n",
 "Chat models support the assignment of distinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from the AI, users, and instructions such as system messages.\n",
 "\n",
 "Although the underlying models are messages in, message out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take a string as input.\n",
 "This gives them the same interface as LLMs (and simpler to use).\n",
 "When a string is passed in as input, it will be converted to a \\`HumanMessage\\` under the hood before being passed to the underlying model.\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations.\n",
 "\n",
 "We have some standardized parameters when constructing ChatModels:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \\`model\\`: the name of the model\n",
 "\n",
 "Chat Models also accept other parameters that are specific to that integration.\n",
 "\n",
 ":::important\n",
 "Some chat models have been fine-tuned for **tool calling** and provide a dedicated API for it.\n",
 "Generally, such models are better at tool calling than non-fine-tuned models, and are recommended for use cases that require tool calling.\n",
 "Please see the [tool calling section](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) for more information.\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use chat models, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#chat-models).\n",
 "\n",
 "#### Multimodality\n",
 "\n",
 "Some chat models are multimodal, accepting images, audio and even video as inputs.\n",
 "These are still less common, meaning model providers haven't standardized on the \"best\" way to define the API.\n",
 "Multimodal outputs are even less common. As such, we've kept our multimodal abstractions fairly light weight\n",
 "and plan to further solidify the multimodal APIs and interaction patterns as the field matures.\n",
 "\n",
 "In LangChain, most chat models that support multimodal inputs also accept those values in OpenAI's content blocks format.\n",
 "So far this is restricted to image inputs. For models like Gemini which support video and other bytes input, the APIs also support the native, model-specific representations.\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use multimodal models, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#multimodal).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LLMs\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"llm,llms\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 ":::caution\n",
 "Pure text-in/text-out LLMs tend to be older or lower-level. Many popular models are best used as [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models),\n",
 "even for non-chat use cases.\n",
 "\n",
 "You are probably looking for [the section above instead](/docs/concepts/chat_models).\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "Language models that takes a string as input and returns a string.\n",
 "These are traditionally older models (newer models generally are [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models), see above).\n",
 "\n",
 "Although the underlying models are string in, string out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take messages as input.\n",
 "This gives them the same interface as [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models).\n",
 "When messages are passed in as input, they will be formatted into a string under the hood before being passed to the underlying model.\n",

 "LangChain does not host any LLMs, rather we rely on third party integrations.\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use LLMs, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#llms).\n",
 "\n",
 "### Message types\n",
 "\n",
 "Some language models take an array of messages as input and return a message.\n",
 "There are a few different types of messages.\n",
 "All messages have a \\`role\\`, \\`content\\`, and \\`response_metadata\\` property.\n",
 "\n",
 "The \\`role\\` describes WHO is saying the message.\n",
 "LangChain has different message classes for different roles.\n",
 "\n",
 "The \\`content\\` property describes the content of the message.\n",
 "This can be a few different things:\n",
 "\n",
 "- A string (most models deal this type of content)\n",
 "- A List of objects (this is used for multi-modal input, where the object contains information about that input type and that input location)\n",
 "\n",
 "#### HumanMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a message from the user.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### AIMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a message from the model. In addition to the \\`content\\` property, these messages also have:\n",
 "\n",
 "**\\`response_metadata\\`**\n",
 "\n",
 "The \\`response_metadata\\` property contains additional metadata about the response. The data here is often specific to each model provider.\n",
 "This is where information like log-probs and token usage may be stored.\n",
 "\n",
 "**\\`tool_calls\\`**\n",
 "\n",
 "These represent a decision from an language model to call a tool. They are included as part of an \\`AIMessage\\` output.\n",
 "They can be accessed from there with the \\`.tool_calls\\` property.\n",
 "\n",
 "This property returns a list of \\`ToolCall\\`s. A \\`ToolCall\\` is an object with the following arguments:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \\`name\\`: The name of the tool that should be called.\n",
 "- \\`args\\`: The arguments to that tool.\n",
 "- \\`id\\`: The id of that tool call.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### SystemMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents a system message, which tells the model how to behave. Not every model provider supports this.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### ToolMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents the result of a tool call. In addition to \\`role\\` and \\`content\\`, this message has:\n",
 "\n",
 "- a \\`tool_call_id\\` field which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.\n",
 "- an \\`artifact\\` field which can be used to pass along arbitrary artifacts of the tool execution which are useful to track but which should not be sent to the model.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### (Legacy) FunctionMessage\n",
 "\n",
 "This is a legacy message type, corresponding to OpenAI's legacy function-calling API. \\`ToolMessage\\` should be used instead to correspond to the updated tool-calling API.\n",
 "\n",
 "This represents the result of a function call. In addition to \\`role\\` and \\`content\\`, this message has a \\`name\\` parameter which conveys the name of the function that was called to produce this result.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Prompt templates\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"prompt,prompttemplate,chatprompttemplate\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model.\n",
 "This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt Templates take as input an object, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.\n",
 "\n",
 "Prompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a string or an array of messages.\n",
 "The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.\n",
 "\n",
 "There are a few different types of prompt templates:\n",
 "\n",
 "#### String PromptTemplates\n",
 "\n",
 "These prompt templates are used to format a single string, and generally are used for simpler inputs.\n",
 "For example, a common way to construct and use a PromptTemplate is as follows:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import { PromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(\n",
 " \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\"\n",
 ");\n",
 "\n",
 "await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: \"cats\" });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "#### ChatPromptTemplates\n",
 "\n",
 "These prompt templates are used to format an array of messages. These \"templates\" consist of an array of templates themselves.\n",
 "For example, a common way to construct and use a ChatPromptTemplate is as follows:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import { ChatPromptTemplate } from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " [\"user\", \"Tell me a joke about {topic}\"],\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\n",
 "await promptTemplate.invoke({ topic: \"cats\" });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "In the above example, this ChatPromptTemplate will construct two messages when called.\n",
 "The first is a system message, that has no variables to format.\n",
 "The second is a HumanMessage, and will be formatted by the \\`topic\\` variable the user passes in.\n",
 "\n",
 "#### MessagesPlaceholder\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"messagesplaceholder\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 "This prompt template is responsible for adding an array of messages in a particular place.\n",
 "In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw how we could format two messages, each one a string.\n",
 "But what if we wanted the user to pass in an array of messages that we would slot into a particular spot?\n",
 "This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder.\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "import {\n",
 " ChatPromptTemplate,\n",
 " MessagesPlaceholder,\n",
 "} from \"@langchain/core/prompts\";\n",
 "import { HumanMessage } from \"@langchain/core/messages\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " new MessagesPlaceholder(\"msgs\"),\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\n",
 "promptTemplate.invoke({ msgs: [new HumanMessage({ content: \"hi!\" })] });\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "This will produce an array of two messages, the first one being a system message, and the second one being the HumanMessage we passed in.\n",
 "If we had passed in 5 messages, then it would have produced 6 messages in total (the system message plus the 5 passed in).\n",
 "This is useful for letting an array of messages be slotted into a particular spot.\n",
 "\n",
 "An alternative way to accomplish the same thing without using the \\`MessagesPlaceholder\\` class explicitly is:\n",
 "\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`typescript\n",
 "const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([\n",
 " [\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant\"],\n",
 " [\"placeholder\", \"{msgs}\"], // <-- This is the changed part\n",
 "]);\n",
 "\\`\\`\\`\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use prompt templates, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#prompt-templates).\n",
 "\n",
 "### Example Selectors\n",
 "\n",
 "One common prompting technique for achieving better performance is to include examples as part of the prompt.\n",
 "This gives the language model concrete examples of how it should behave.\n",
 "Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for more advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them.\n",
 "Example Selectors are classes responsible for selecting and then formatting examples into prompts.\n",
 "\n",
 "For specifics on how to use example selectors, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#example-selectors).\n",
 "\n",
 "### Output parsers\n",
 "\n",
 "<span data-heading-keywords=\"output parser\"></span>\n",
 "\n",
 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "The information here refers to parsers that take a text output from a model try to parse it into a more structured representation.\n",
 "More and more models are supporting function (or tool) calling, which handles this automatically.\n",
 "It is recommended to use function/tool calling rather than output parsing.\n",
 "See documentation for that [here](/docs/concepts/tool_calling).\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks.\n",
 "Useful when you are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.\n",
 "\n",
 "There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\n",
 "- \"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\n",
 "\n",
 "And then one optional one:\n",
 "\n",
 "- \"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\n",
 "\n",
 "Output parsers accept a string or \\`BaseMessage\\` as input and can return an arbitrary type.\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain has many different types of output parsers. This is a list of output parsers LangChain supports. The table below has various pieces of information:\n",
 "\n",
 "**Name**: The name of the output parser\n",
 "\n",
 "**Supports Streaming**: Whether the output parser supports streaming.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Input Type**: Expected input type. Most output parsers work on both strings and messages, but some (like OpenAI Functions) need a message with specific arguments.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Output Type**: The output type of the object returned by the parser.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Description**: Our commentary on this output parser and when to use it.\n",

# ChatPrem

## Setup

1. Create a Prem AI account and get your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/accounts/signup/).
2. Export or set your API key inline. The ChatPrem class defaults to `process.env.PREM_API_KEY`.

```bash
export PREM_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

You can use models provided by Prem AI as follows:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import PremAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_premai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{PremAI}</CodeBlock>

You can pass in the optional `returnPromptLayerId` boolean to get a `promptLayerRequestId` like below. Here is an example of getting the PromptLayerChatOpenAI requestID:

```typescript
import { PromptLayerChatOpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const chat = new PromptLayerChatOpenAI({
 returnPromptLayerId: true,
});

const respA = await chat.generate([
 [
 new SystemMessage(
 "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."
 ),
 ],
]);

console.log(JSON.stringify(respA, null, 3));

# ChatTencentHunyuan

LangChain.js supports the Tencent Hunyuan family of models.

https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1729/104753

## Setup

1. Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/register).
2. Create SecretID & SecretKey [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi).
3. Set SecretID and SecretKey as environment variables named `TENCENT_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENT_SECRET_KEY`, respectively.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

If you are using LangChain.js in a browser environment, you'll also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install crypto-js
```

And then make sure that you import from the `web` as shown below.

# WebLLM

:::tip Compatibility
Only available in web environments.
:::

You can run LLMs directly in your web browser using LangChain's [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai) integration.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [WebLLM SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) module to communicate with your local model.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @mlc-ai/web-llm @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

Note that the first time a model is called, WebLLM will download the full weights for that model. This can be multiple gigabytes, and may not be possible for all end-users of your application depending on their internet connection and computer specs.
While the browser will cache future invocations of that model, we recommend using the smallest possible model you can.

We also recommend using a [separate web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) when invoking and loading your models to
not block execution.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/models/chat/integration_webllm.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Streaming is also supported.

## Example

For a full end-to-end example, check out [this project](https://github.com/jacoblee93/fully-local-pdf-chatbot).

# ChatYandexGPT

LangChain.js supports calling [YandexGPT](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/services/yandexgpt) chat models.

## Setup

First, you should [create a service account](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/sa/create) with the `ai.languageModels.user` role.

Next, you have two authentication options:

- [IAM token](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa).
 You can specify the token in a constructor parameter as `iam_token` or in an environment variable `YC_IAM_TOKEN`.
- [API key](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/api-key/create)
 You can specify the key in a constructor parameter as `api_key` or in an environment variable `YC_API_KEY`.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/yandex @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import YandexGPTChatExample from "@examples/models/chat/integration_yandex.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{YandexGPTChatExample}</CodeBlock>

# ChatZhipuAI

LangChain.js supports the Zhipu AI family of models.

https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/model

## Setup

You'll need to sign up for an Zhipu API key and set it as an environment variable named `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`

https://open.bigmodel.cn

You'll also need to install the following dependencies:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core jsonwebtoken
```

## Usage

Here's an example:

import ZhipuAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_zhipuai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ZhipuAI}</CodeBlock>

# Cohere Rerank

Reranking documents can greatly improve any RAG application and document retrieval system.

At a high level, a rerank API is a language model which analyzes documents and reorders them based on their relevance to a given query.

Cohere offers an API for reranking documents. In this example we'll show you how to use it.

## Setup

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/cohere @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import Example from "@examples/document_compressors/cohere_rerank.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Here, we can see the `.rerank()` method returns just the index of the documents (matching the indexes of the input documents) and their relevancy scores.

If we'd like to have the documents returned from the method itself, we can use the `.compressDocuments()` method.

import ExampleCompressor from "@examples/document_compressors/cohere_rerank_compressor.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleCompressor}</CodeBlock>

From the results, we can see it returned the top 3 documents, and assigned a `relevanceScore` to each.

As expected, the document with the highest `relevanceScore` is the one that references Washington, D.C., with a score of `98.7%`!

### Usage with `CohereClient`

If you are using Cohere on Azure, AWS Bedrock or a standalone instance you can use the `CohereClient` to create a `CohereRerank` instance with your endpoint.

import ExampleClient from "@examples/document_compressors/cohere_rerank_custom_client.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleClient}</CodeBlock>
```

# Mixedbread AI reranking

## Overview

This guide will help you integrate and use the [Mixedbread AI](https://mixedbread.ai/) reranking API. The reranking API allows you to reorder a list of documents based on a given query, improving the relevance of search results or any ranked list.

## Installation

To get started, install the `@langchain/mixedbread-ai` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash
npm install @langchain/mixedbread-ai
```

## Authentication

Obtain your API key by signing up at [Mixedbread AI](https://mixedbread.ai/). You can then set the `MXBAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your Mixedbread AI API key or pass it directly as the `apiKey` option when constructing the class.

## Using Reranking

The `MixedbreadAIReranker` class provides access to the reranking API. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Import the Class**: First, import the `MixedbreadAIReranker` class from the package.

```typescript
import { MixedbreadAIReranker } from "@langchain/mixedbread-ai";
```

2. **Instantiate the Class**: Create an instance of `MixedbreadAIReranker` with your API key.

```typescript
const reranker = new MixedbreadAIReranker({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });
```

3. **Rerank Documents**: Use the `rerankDocuments` method to reorder documents based on a query.

```typescript
const documents = [
 { pageContent: "To bake bread you need flour" },
 { pageContent: "To bake bread you need yeast" },
 { pageContent: "To eat bread you need nothing but good taste" },
];
const query = "What do you need to bake bread?";
const result = await reranker.compressDocuments(documents, query);
console.log(result);
```

## Additional Resources

For more information, refer to the [Reranking API documentation](https://www.mixedbread.ai/docs/reranking/overview).

# Document loaders

[Document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders) load data into LangChain's expected format for use-cases such as [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/tutorials/rag).

LangChain.js categorizes document loaders in two different ways:

- [File loaders](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/), which load data into LangChain formats from your local filesystem.
- [Web loaders](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/), which load data from remote sources.

See the individual pages for more on each category.

:::info
If you'd like to write your own document loader, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/document_loader_custom/). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).

# ChatGPT files

This example goes over how to load conversations.json from your ChatGPT data export folder. You can get your data export by email by going to: ChatGPT -> (Profile) - Settings -> Export data -> Confirm export -> Check email.

## Usage, extracting all logs

Example code:

```typescript
import { ChatGPTLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/chatgpt";

const loader = new ChatGPTLoader("./example_data/example_conversations.json");

const docs = await loader.load();

console.log(docs);
```

## Usage, extracting a single log

Example code:

```typescript
import { ChatGPTLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/chatgpt";

const loader = new ChatGPTLoader(
 "./example_data/example_conversations.json",
 1
);

const docs = await loader.load();

console.log(docs);
```

# Docx files

The `DocxLoader` allows you to extract text data from Microsoft Word documents. It supports both the modern `.docx` format and the legacy `.doc` format. Depending on the file type, additional dependencies are required.

---

## Setup

To use `DocxLoader`, you'll need the `@langchain/community` integration along with either `mammoth` or `word-extractor` package:

- **`mammoth`**: For processing `.docx` files.
- **`word-extractor`**: For handling `.doc` files.

### Installation

#### For `.docx` Files

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core mammoth
```

#### For `.doc` Files

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core word-extractor
```

## Usage

### Loading `.docx` Files

For `.docx` files, there is no need to explicitly specify any parameters when initializing the loader:

```javascript
import { DocxLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/docx";

const loader = new DocxLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/tests/example_data/attention.docx"
);

const docs = await loader.load();
```

### Loading `.doc` Files

For `.doc` files, you must explicitly specify the `type` as `doc` when initializing the loader:

```javascript
import { DocxLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/docx";

const loader = new DocxLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/tests/example_data/attention.doc",
 {
 type: "doc",
 }
);

const docs = await loader.load();
```

# EPUB files

This example goes over how to load data from EPUB files. By default, one document will be created for each chapter in the EPUB file, you can change this behavior by setting the `splitChapters` option to `false`.

# Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core epub2 html-to-text
```

# Usage, one document per chapter

```typescript
import { EPubLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/epub";

const loader = new EPubLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.epub");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

# Usage, one document per file

```typescript
import { EPubLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/epub";

const loader = new EPubLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.epub",
 {
 splitChapters: false,
 }
);

# JSON files

The JSON loader use [JSON pointer](https://github.com/janl/node-jsonpointer) to target keys in your JSON files you want to target.

### No JSON pointer example

The most simple way of using it, is to specify no JSON pointer.
The loader will load all strings it finds in the JSON object.

Example JSON file:

```json
{
 "texts": ["This is a sentence.", "This is another sentence."]
}
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json");

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 1,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is a sentence.",
 },
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 2,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "This is another sentence.",
 },
]
*/
```

### Using JSON pointer example

You can do a more advanced scenario by choosing which keys in your JSON object you want to extract string from.

In this example, we want to only extract information from "from" and "surname" entries.

```json
{
 "1": {
 "body": "BD 2023 SUMMER",
 "from": "LinkedIn Job",
 "labels": ["IMPORTANT", "CATEGORY_UPDATES", "INBOX"]
 },
 "2": {
 "body": "Intern, Treasury and other roles are available",
 "from": "LinkedIn Job2",
 "labels": ["IMPORTANT"],
 "other": {
 "name": "plop",
 "surname": "bob"
 }
 }
}
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { JSONLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

const loader = new JSONLoader(
 "src/document_loaders/example_data/example.json",
 ["/from", "/surname"]
);

const docs = await loader.load();
/*
[
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 1,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "BD 2023 SUMMER",
 },
 Document {
 "metadata": {
 "blobType": "application/json",
 "line": 2,
 "source": "blob",
 },
 "pageContent": "LinkedIn Job",
 },
 ...
]
```
```

# JSONLines files

This example goes over how to load data from JSONLines or JSONL files. The second argument is a JSONPointer to the property to extract from each JSON object in the file. One document will be created for each JSON object in the file.

Example JSONLines file:

```json
{"html": "This is a sentence."}
{"html": "This is another sentence."}
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { JSONLinesLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";

# Multiple individual files

This example goes over how to load data from multiple file paths. The second argument is a map of file extensions to loader factories. Each file will be passed to the matching loader, and the resulting documents will be concatenated together.

Example files:

```text
src/document_loaders/example_data/example/
├── example.txt
└── example.csv

src/document_loaders/example_data/example2/
├── example.json
└── example.jsonl
```

Example code:

```typescript
import { MultiFileLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/multi_file";
import {
 JSONLoader,
 JSONLinesLoader,
} from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/json";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CSVLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/csv";

const loader = new MultiFileLoader(

# Notion markdown export

This example goes over how to load data from your Notion pages exported from the notion dashboard.

First, export your notion pages as **Markdown & CSV** as per the offical explanation [here](https://www.notion.so/help/export-your-content). Make sure to select `include subpages` and `Create folders for subpages.`

Then, unzip the downloaded file and move the unzipped folder into your repository. It should contain the markdown files of your pages.

Once the folder is in your repository, simply run the example below:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/notion_markdown.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# Open AI Whisper Audio

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This covers how to load document objects from an audio file using the [Open AI Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text) API.

## Setup

To run this loader you will need to create an account on the Open AI and obtain an auth key from the https://platform.openai.com/account page.

## Usage

Once auth key is configured, you can use the loader to create transcriptions and then convert them into a Document.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/openai_whisper_audio.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# PPTX files

This example goes over how to load data from PPTX files. By default, one document will be created for all pages in the PPTX file.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install officeparser
```

## Usage, one document per page

```typescript
import { PPTXLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pptx";

const loader = new PPTXLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pptx");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

# AirtableLoader

The `AirtableLoader` class provides functionality to load documents from Airtable tables. It supports two main methods:

1. `load()`: Retrieves all records at once, ideal for small to moderate datasets.
2. `loadLazy()`: Fetches records one by one, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your Airtable API token is available as an environment variable:

```typescript
process.env.AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN";
```

## Usage

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{loadExample}</CodeBlock>

# Apify Dataset

This guide shows how to use [Apify](https://apify.com) with LangChain to load documents from an Apify Dataset.

## Overview

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction,
which provides an [ecosystem](https://apify.com/store) of more than two thousand
ready-made apps called _Actors_ for various web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases.

This guide shows how to load documents
from an [Apify Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset) — a scalable append-only
storage built for storing structured web scraping results,
such as a list of products or Google SERPs, and then export them to various
formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel.

Datasets are typically used to save results of different Actors.
For example, [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor
deeply crawls websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs,
and then stores the text content of webpages into a dataset,
from which you can feed the documents into a vector database and use it for information retrieval.
Another example is the [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser) Actor,
which queries Google Search, scrapes the top N pages from the results, and returns the cleaned
content in Markdown format for further processing by a large language model.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the official Apify client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install apify-client
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install hnswlib-node @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to sign up and retrieve your [Apify API token](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations).

## Usage

### From a New Dataset (Crawl a Website and Store the data in Apify Dataset)

If you don't already have an existing dataset on the Apify platform, you'll need to initialize the document loader by calling an Actor and waiting for the results.
In the example below, we use the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor to crawl
LangChain documentation, store the results in Apify Dataset, and then load the dataset using the `ApifyDatasetLoader`.
For this demonstration, we'll use a fast Cheerio crawler type and limit the number of crawled pages to 10.

**Note:** Running the Website Content Crawler may take some time, depending on the size of the website. For large sites, it can take several hours or even days!

Here's an example:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import NewExample from "@examples/document_loaders/apify_dataset_new.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{NewExample}</CodeBlock>

## From an Existing Dataset

If you've already run an Actor and have an existing dataset on the Apify platform, you can initialize the document loader directly using the constructor

import ExistingExample from "@examples/document_loaders/apify_dataset_existing.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExistingExample}</CodeBlock>
```

# AssemblyAI Audio Transcript

This covers how to load audio (and video) transcripts as document objects from a file using the [AssemblyAI API](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit?utm_source=langchainjs).

## Usage

First, you'll need to install the official AssemblyAI package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core assemblyai
```

To use the loaders you need an [AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup?utm_source=langchainjs) and
[get your AssemblyAI API key from the dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account?utm_source=langchainjs).

Then, configure the API key as the `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` environment variable or the `apiKey` options parameter.

import TranscriptExample from "@examples/document_loaders/assemblyai_audio_transcription.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TranscriptExample}</CodeBlock>

> ** info **
>
> - You can use the `AudioTranscriptParagraphsLoader` or `AudioTranscriptSentencesLoader` to split the transcript into paragraphs or sentences.
> - The `audio` parameter can be a URL, a local file path, a buffer, or a stream.
> - The `audio` can also be a video file. See the [list of supported file types in the FAQ doc](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/concepts/faq?utm_source=langchainjs#:~:text=file%20types%20are%20supported).
> - If you don't pass in the `apiKey` option, the loader will use the `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
> - You can add more properties in addition to `audio`. Find the full list of request parameters in the [AssemblyAI API docs](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/submit?utm_source=langchainjs#create-a-transcript).

You can also use the `AudioSubtitleLoader` to get `srt` or `vtt` subtitles as a document.

import SubtitleExample from "@examples/document_loaders/assemblyai_subtitles.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SubtitleExample}</CodeBlock>
```

# Azure Blob Storage Container

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This covers how to load a container on Azure Blob Storage into LangChain documents.

## Setup

To run this loader, you'll need to have Unstructured already set up and ready to use at an available URL endpoint. It can also be configured to run locally.

See the docs [here](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/unstructured) for information on how to do that.

You'll also need to install the official Azure Storage Blob client library:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @azure/storage-blob
```

## Usage

Once Unstructured is configured, you can use the Azure Blob Storage Container loader to load files and then convert them into a Document.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/azure_blob_storage_container.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# Couchbase

[Couchbase](http://couchbase.com/) is an award-winning distributed NoSQL cloud database that delivers unmatched versatility, performance, scalability, and financial value for all of your cloud, mobile, AI, and edge computing applications.

This guide shows how to use load documents from couchbase database.

# Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core couchbase
```

## Usage

### Querying for Documents from Couchbase

For more details on connecting to a Couchbase cluster, please check the [Node.js SDK documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#connection-strings).

For help with querying for documents using SQL++ (SQL for JSON), please check the [documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index.html).

```typescript
import { CouchbaseDocumentLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/couchbase";
import { Cluster } from "couchbase";

const connectionString = "couchbase://localhost"; // valid couchbase connection string
const dbUsername = "Administrator"; // valid database user with read access to the bucket being queried
const dbPassword = "Password"; // password for the database user

// query is a valid SQL++ query
const query = `
 SELECT h.* FROM \`travel-sample\`.inventory.hotel h 
 WHERE h.country = 'United States'
 LIMIT 1
`;
```

### Connect to Couchbase Cluster

```typescript
const couchbaseClient = await Cluster.connect(connectionString, {
 username: dbUsername,
 password: dbPassword,
 configProfile: "wanDevelopment",
});
```

### Create the Loader

```typescript
const loader = new CouchbaseDocumentLoader(
 couchbaseClient, // The connected couchbase cluster client
 query // A valid SQL++ query which will return the required data
);
```

### Load Documents

You can fetch the documents by calling the `load` method of the loader. It will return a list with all the documents. If you want to avoid this blocking call, you can call `lazy_load` method that returns an Iterator.

```typescript
// using load method
docs = await loader.load();
console.log(docs);
```

```typescript
// using lazy_load
for await (const doc of this.lazyLoad()) {
 console.log(doc);
 break; // break based on required condition
}
```

### Specifying Fields with Content and Metadata

The fields that are part of the Document content can be specified using the `pageContentFields` parameter.
The metadata fields for the Document can be specified using the `metadataFields` parameter.

```typescript
const loaderWithSelectedFields = new CouchbaseDocumentLoader(
 couchbaseClient,
 query,
 // pageContentFields
 [
 "address",
 "name",
 "city",
 "phone",
 "country",
 "geo",
 "description",
 "reviews",
 ],
 ["id"] // metadataFields
);

const filtered_docs = await loaderWithSelectedFields.load();
console.log(filtered_docs);
```
```

# Figma

This example goes over how to load data from a Figma file.
You will need a Figma access token in order to get started.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/figma.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

You can find your Figma file's key and node ids by opening the file in your browser and extracting them from the URL:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/<YOUR FILE KEY HERE>/LangChainJS-Test?type=whiteboard&node-id=<YOUR NODE ID HERE>&t=e6lqWkKecuYQRyRg-0

# GitBook

This example goes over how to load data from any GitBook, using Cheerio. One document will be created for each page.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core cheerio
```

## Load from single GitBook page

```typescript
import { GitbookLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/gitbook";

const loader = new GitbookLoader(
 "https://docs.gitbook.com/product-tour/navigation"
);

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Load from all paths in a given GitBook

For this to work, the GitbookLoader needs to be initialized with the root path (https://docs.gitbook.com in this example) and have `shouldLoadAllPaths` set to `true`.

```typescript
import { GitbookLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/gitbook";

const loader = new GitbookLoader("https://docs.gitbook.com", {
 shouldLoadAllPaths: true,
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```

# GitHub

This example goes over how to load data from a GitHub repository.
You can set the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to a GitHub access token to increase the rate limit and access private repositories.

## Setup

The GitHub loader requires the [ignore npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore) as a peer dependency. Install it like this:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core ignore
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/github.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

The loader will ignore binary files like images.

### Using .gitignore Syntax

To ignore specific files, you can pass in an `ignorePaths` array into the constructor:

import IgnoreExample from "@examples/document_loaders/github_ignore_paths.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{IgnoreExample}</CodeBlock>

### Using a Different GitHub Instance

You may want to target a different GitHub instance than `github.com`, e.g. if you have a GitHub Enterprise instance for your company.
For this you need two additional parameters:

- `baseUrl` - the base URL of your GitHub instance, so the githubUrl matches `<baseUrl>/<owner>/<repo>/...`
- `apiUrl` - the URL of the API endpoint of your GitHub instance

import CustomInstanceExample from "@examples/document_loaders/github_custom_instance.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomInstanceExample}</CodeBlock>

### Dealing with Submodules

In case your repository has submodules, you have to decide if the loader should follow them or not. You can control this with the boolean `processSubmodules` parameter. By default, submodules are not processed.
Note that processing submodules works only in conjunction with setting the `recursive` parameter to true.

import SubmodulesExample from "@examples/document_loaders/github_submodules.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SubmodulesExample}</CodeBlock>

Note, that the loader will not follow submodules which are located on another GitHub instance than the one of the current repository.

### Stream large repository

For situations where processing large repositories in a memory-efficient manner is required. You can use the `loadAsStream` method to asynchronously streams documents from the entire GitHub repository.

import StreamExample from "@examples/document_loaders/github_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamExample}</CodeBlock>
```

# Notion API

This guide will take you through the steps required to load documents from Notion pages and databases using the Notion API.

## Overview

Notion is a versatile productivity platform that consolidates note-taking, task management, and data organization tools into one interface.

This document loader is able to take full Notion pages and databases and turn them into a LangChain Documents ready to be integrated into your projects.

## Setup

1. You will first need to install the official Notion client and the [notion-to-md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-to-md) package as peer dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @notionhq/client notion-to-md
```

2. Create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and securely record the Internal Integration Secret (also known as `NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN`).
3. Add a connection to your new integration on your page or database. To do this open your Notion page, go to the settings pips in the top right and scroll down to `Add connections` and select your new integration.
4. Get the `PAGE_ID` or `DATABASE_ID` for the page or database you want to load.

> The 32 char hex in the url path represents the `ID`. For example:

> PAGE_ID: [https://www.notion.so/skarard/LangChain-Notion-API-`b34ca03f219c4420a6046fc4bdfdf7b4`](https://www.notion.so/skarard/LangChain-Notion-API-b34ca03f219c4420a6046fc4bdfdf7b4)

> DATABASE_ID: [https://www.notion.so/skarard/`c393f19c3903440da0d34bf9c6c12ff2`?v=9c70a0f4e174498aa0f9021e0a9d52de](https://www.notion.so/skarard/c393f19c3903440da0d34bf9c6c12ff2?v=9c70a0f4e174498aa0f9021e0a9d52de)

> REGEX: `/(?<!=)[0-9a-f]{32}/`

## Example Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/notionapi.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# S3 File

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This covers how to load document objects from an s3 file object.

## Setup

To run this index you'll need to have Unstructured already set up and ready to use at an available URL endpoint. It can also be configured to run locally.

See the docs [here](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/unstructured) for information on how to do that.

You'll also need to install the official AWS SDK:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

## Usage

Once Unstructured is configured, you can use the S3 loader to load files and then convert them into a Document.

You can optionally provide a s3Config parameter to specify your bucket region, access key, and secret access key. If these are not provided, you will need to have them in your environment (e.g., by running `aws configure`).

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/s3.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# SearchApi Loader

This guide shows how to use SearchApi with LangChain to load web search results.

## Overview

[SearchApi](https://www.searchapi.io/) is a real-time API that grants developers access to results from a variety of search engines, including engines like [Google Search](https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google),
[Google News](https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google-news), [Google Scholar](https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google-scholar), [YouTube Transcripts](https://www.searchapi.io/docs/youtube-transcripts) or any other engine that could be found in documentation.
This API enables developers and businesses to scrape and extract meaningful data directly from the result pages of all these search engines, providing valuable insights for different use-cases.

This guide shows how to load web search results using the `SearchApiLoader` in LangChain. The `SearchApiLoader` simplifies the process of loading and processing web search results from SearchApi.

## Setup

You'll need to sign up and retrieve your [SearchApi API key](https://www.searchapi.io/).

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `SearchApiLoader`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/searchapi.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @langchain/openai
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

In this example, the `SearchApiLoader` is used to load web search results, which are then stored in memory using `MemoryVectorStore`. A retrieval chain is then used to retrieve the most relevant documents from the memory and answer the question based on these documents. This demonstrates how the `SearchApiLoader` can streamline the process of loading and processing web search results.

[SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) is a real-time API that provides access to search results from various search engines. It is commonly used for tasks like competitor analysis and rank tracking. It empowers businesses to scrape, extract, and make sense of data from all search engines' result pages.

This guide shows how to load web search results using the `SerpAPILoader` in LangChain. The `SerpAPILoader` simplifies the process of loading and processing web search results from SerpAPI.

## Setup

You'll need to sign up and retrieve your [SerpAPI API key](https://serpapi.com/dashboard).

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `SerpAPILoader`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/serpapi.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @langchain/openai
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

In this example, the `SerpAPILoader` is used to load web search results, which are then stored in memory using `MemoryVectorStore`. A retrieval chain is then used to retrieve the most relevant documents from the memory and answer the question based on these documents. This demonstrates how the `SerpAPILoader` can streamline the process of loading and processing web search results.

# Sitemap Loader

This notebook goes over how to use the [`SitemapLoader`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_community.document_loaders_web_sitemap.SitemapLoader.html) class to load sitemaps into `Document`s.

## Setup

First, we need to install the `langchain` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

The URL passed in must either contain the `.xml` path to the sitemap, or a default `/sitemap.xml` will be appended to the URL.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/sitemap.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Or, if you want to only load the sitemap and not the contents of each page from the sitemap, you can use the `parseSitemap` method:

import ParseSitemapExample from "@examples/document_loaders/parse_sitemap.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ParseSitemapExample}</CodeBlock>
```

# Sonix Audio

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This covers how to load document objects from an audio file using the [Sonix](https://sonix.ai/) API.

## Setup

To run this loader you will need to create an account on the https://sonix.ai/ and obtain an auth key from the https://my.sonix.ai/api page.

You'll also need to install the `sonix-speech-recognition` library:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core sonix-speech-recognition
```

## Usage

Once auth key is configured, you can use the loader to create transcriptions and then convert them into a Document.
In the `request` parameter, you can either specify a local file by setting `audioFilePath` or a remote file using `audioUrl`.
You will also need to specify the audio language. See the list of supported languages [here](https://sonix.ai/docs/api#languages).

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/sonix_audio_transcription.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Spider

[Spider](https://spider.cloud/?ref=langchainjs) is the [fastest](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider/blob/main/benches/BENCHMARKS.md#benchmark-results) crawler. It converts any website into pure HTML, markdown, metadata or text while enabling you to crawl with custom actions using AI.

## Overview

Spider allows you to use high performance proxies to prevent detection, caches AI actions, webhooks for crawling status, scheduled crawls etc...

This guide shows how to crawl/scrape a website using [Spider](https://spider.cloud/) and loading the LLM-ready documents with `SpiderLoader` in LanghChain.

## Setup

Get your own Spider API key on [spider.cloud](https://spider.cloud/).

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `SpiderLoader`:

Spider offers two scraping modes `scrape` and `crawl`. Scrape only gets the content of the url provided while crawl gets the content of the url provided and crawls deeper following subpages.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/spider.ts";

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @spider-cloud/spider-client
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Webpages, with Playwright

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This example goes over how to load data from webpages using Playwright. One document will be created for each webpage.

Playwright is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling multiple browser engines, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can use Playwright to automate web page interactions, including extracting data from dynamic web pages that require JavaScript to render.

If you want a lighterweight solution, and the webpages you want to load do not require JavaScript to render, you can use the [`CheerioWebBaseLoader`](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/web_cheerio) instead.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core playwright
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { PlaywrightWebBaseLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/playwright";

/**
 * Loader uses `page.content()`
 * as default evaluate function
 **/
const loader = new PlaywrightWebBaseLoader("https://www.tabnews.com.br/");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Options

Here's an explanation of the parameters you can pass to the PlaywrightWebBaseLoader constructor using the PlaywrightWebBaseLoaderOptions interface:

```typescript
type PlaywrightWebBaseLoaderOptions = {
 launchOptions?: LaunchOptions;
 gotoOptions?: PlaywrightGotoOptions;
 evaluate?: PlaywrightEvaluate;
};
```

1. `launchOptions`: an optional object that specifies additional options to pass to the playwright.chromium.launch() method. This can include options such as the headless flag to launch the browser in headless mode.

2. `gotoOptions`: an optional object that specifies additional options to pass to the page.goto() method. This can include options such as the timeout option to specify the maximum navigation time in milliseconds, or the waitUntil option to specify when to consider the navigation as successful.

3. `evaluate`: an optional function that can be used to evaluate JavaScript code on the page using a custom evaluation function. This can be useful for extracting data from the page, interacting with page elements, or handling specific HTTP responses. The function should return a Promise that resolves to a string containing the result of the evaluation.

By passing these options to the `PlaywrightWebBaseLoader` constructor, you can customize the behavior of the loader and use Playwright's powerful features to scrape and interact with web pages.

Here is a basic example to do it:

```typescript
import {
 PlaywrightWebBaseLoader,
 Page,
 Browser,
} from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/playwright";

const url = "https://www.tabnews.com.br/";
const loader = new PlaywrightWebBaseLoader(url);
const docs = await loader.load();

// raw HTML page content
const extractedContents = docs[0].pageContent;
```

And a more advanced example:

```typescript
import {
 PlaywrightWebBaseLoader,
 Page,
 Browser,
} from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/playwright";

const loader = new PlaywrightWebBaseLoader("https://www.tabnews.com.br/", {
 launchOptions: {
 headless: true,
 },
 gotoOptions: {
 waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
 },
 /** Pass custom evaluate, in this case you get page and browser instances */
 async evaluate(page: Page, browser: Browser, response: Response | null) {
 await page.waitForResponse("https://www.tabnews.com.br/va/view");

 const result = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.innerHTML);
 return result;
 },
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```
```

# YouTube transcripts

This covers how to load YouTube transcripts into LangChain documents.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [youtubei.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtubei.js) to extract metadata:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core youtubei.js
```

## Usage

You need to specify a link to the video in the `url`. You can also specify `language` in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and `addVideoInfo` flag.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/youtube.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
```

# html-to-text

When ingesting HTML documents for later retrieval, we are often interested only in the actual content of the webpage rather than semantics.
Stripping HTML tags from documents with the HtmlToTextTransformer can result in more content-rich chunks, making retrieval more effective.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [`html-to-text`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text) npm package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install html-to-text
```

Though not required for the transformer by itself, the below usage examples require [`cheerio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) for scraping:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cheerio
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

The below example scrapes a Hacker News thread, splits it based on HTML tags to group chunks based on the semantic information from the tags,
then extracts content from the individual chunks:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_transformers/html_to_text.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Customization

You can pass the transformer any [arguments accepted by the `html-to-text` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text) to customize how it works.

# @mozilla/readability

When ingesting HTML documents for later retrieval, we are often interested only in the actual content of the webpage rather than semantics.
Stripping HTML tags from documents with the MozillaReadabilityTransformer can result in more content-rich chunks, making retrieval more effective.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [`@mozilla/readability`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mozilla/readability) and the [`jsdom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) npm package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mozilla/readability jsdom
```

Though not required for the transformer by itself, the below usage examples require [`cheerio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) for scraping:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cheerio
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

# OpenAI functions metadata tagger

It can often be useful to tag ingested documents with structured metadata, such as the title, tone, or length of a document, to allow for more targeted similarity search later. However, for large numbers of documents, performing this labelling process manually can be tedious.

The `MetadataTagger` document transformer automates this process by extracting metadata from each provided document according to a provided schema. It uses a configurable OpenAI Functions-powered chain under the hood, so if you pass a custom LLM instance, it must be an OpenAI model with functions support.

**Note:** This document transformer works best with complete documents, so it's best to run it first with whole documents before doing any other splitting or processing!

### Usage

For example, let's say you wanted to index a set of movie reviews. You could initialize the document transformer as follows:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_transformers/metadata_tagger.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

There is an additional `createMetadataTagger` method that accepts a valid JSON Schema object as well.

### Customization

You can pass the underlying tagging chain the standard LLMChain arguments in the second options parameter.
For example, if you wanted to ask the LLM to focus specific details in the input documents, or extract metadata in a certain style, you could pass in a custom prompt:

import CustomExample from "@examples/document_transformers/metadata_tagger_custom_prompt.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomExample}</CodeBlock>
```

# Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Semantic Cache

> The Semantic Cache feature is supported with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL integration, enabling users to retrieve cached responses based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. It leverages [AzureCosmosDBNoSQLVectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmosdb_nosql), which stores vector embeddings of cached prompts. These embeddings enable similarity-based searches, allowing the system to retrieve relevant cached results.

If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-cosmosdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-cosmosdb) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/azure-cosmosdb @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to have an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost, following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the connection string. If you are using Managed Identity, you need to have the endpoint. You can find them in the Azure Portal, under the "Settings / Keys" section of your instance.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

:::info

When using Azure Managed Identity and role-based access control, you must ensure that the database and container have been created beforehand. RBAC does not provide permissions to create databases and containers. You can get more information about the permission model in the [Azure Cosmos DB documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#permission-model).

:::

## Usage example

import Example from "@examples/caches/azure_cosmosdb_nosql/azure_cosmosdb_nosql.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# AWS SageMakerEndpoint

LangChain.js supports integration with AWS SageMaker-hosted endpoints. Check [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) for a list of available models, and how to deploy your own.

## Setup

You'll need to install the official SageMaker SDK as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sagemaker-runtime
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import SageMakerEndpointExample from "@examples/models/llm/sagemaker_endpoint.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SageMakerEndpointExample}</CodeBlock>

# ChromeAI

:::info
This feature is **experimental** and is subject to change.
:::

:::note
The `Built-in AI Early Preview Program` by Google is currently in beta. To apply for access or find more information, please visit [this link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in).
:::

ChromeAI leverages Gemini Nano to run LLMs directly in the browser or in a [worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker),
without the need for an internet connection. This allows for running faster and private models without ever having data leave the consumers device.

## Getting started

Once you've been granted access to the program, follow Google's provided instructions to download the model.

Once downloaded, you can start using `ChromeAI` in the browser as follows:

```typescript
import { ChromeAI } from "@langchain/community/experimental/llms/chrome_ai";

const model = new ChromeAI({
 temperature: 0.5, // Optional, defaults to 0.5
 topK: 40, // Optional, defaults to 40
});

const response = await model.invoke("Write me a short poem please");

/*
 In the realm where moonlight weaves its hue,
 Where dreams and secrets gently intertwine,
 There's a place of tranquility and grace,
 Where whispers of the night find their place.

 Beneath the canopy of starlit skies,
 Where dreams take flight and worries cease,
 A haven of tranquility, pure and true,
 Where the heart finds solace, finding dew.

 In this realm where dreams find their release,
 Where the soul finds peace, at every peace,
 Let us wander, lost in its embrace,
 Finding solace in this tranquil space.
*/
```

### Streaming

`ChromeAI` also supports streaming outputs:

```typescript
import { ChromeAI } from "@langchain/community/experimental/llms/chrome_ai";

const model = new ChromeAI({
 temperature: 0.5, // Optional, defaults to 0.5
 topK: 40, // Optional, defaults to 40
});

for await (const chunk of await model.stream("How are you?")) {
 console.log(chunk);
}

/*
 As
 an
 AI
 language
 model
 ,
 I
 don
 '
 t
 have
 personal
 experiences
 or
 the
 ability
 to
 experience
 emotions
 .
 Therefore
 ,
 I
 cannot
 directly
 answer
 the
 question
 "
 How
 are
 you
 ?".
 
 
 
 May
 I
 suggest
 answering
 something
 else
 ?
*/
```

# DeepInfra

LangChain supports LLMs hosted by [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com/) through the `DeepInfra` wrapper.
First, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll need to obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable named `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`
(or pass it into the constructor), then call the model as shown below:

import Example from "@examples/models/llm/deepinfra.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Gradient AI

LangChain.js supports integration with Gradient AI. Check out [Gradient AI](https://docs.gradient.ai/docs) for a list of available models.

## Setup

You'll need to install the official Gradient Node SDK as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @gradientai/nodejs-sdk
```

You will need to set the following environment variables for using the Gradient AI API.

1. `GRADIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`
2. `GRADIENT_WORKSPACE_ID`

Alternatively, these can be set during the GradientAI Class instantiation as `gradientAccessKey` and `workspaceId` respectively.
For example:

```typescript
const model = new GradientLLM({
 gradientAccessKey: "My secret Access Token"
 workspaceId: "My secret workspace id"
});
```

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import GradientLLMBaseExample from "@examples/llms/gradient_ai-base.ts";
import GradientLLMAdapterExample from "@examples/llms/gradient_ai-adapter.ts";

### Using Gradient's Base Models

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GradientLLMBaseExample}</CodeBlock>

### Using your own fine-tuned Adapters

The use your own custom adapter simply set `adapterId` during setup.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GradientLLMAdapterExample}</CodeBlock>

# LLMs

:::caution
You are currently on a page documenting the use of [text completion models](/docs/concepts/text_llms). Many of the latest and most popular models are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/chat_models).

Unless you are specifically using more advanced prompting techniques, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/).
:::

[LLMs](docs/concepts/#llms) are language models that takes a string as input and return a string as output.

:::info
If you'd like to write your own LLM, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/custom_llm). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).

# Layerup Security

The [Layerup Security](https://uselayerup.com) integration allows you to secure your calls to any LangChain LLM, LLM chain or LLM agent. The LLM object wraps around any existing LLM object, allowing for a secure layer between your users and your LLMs.

While the Layerup Security object is designed as an LLM, it is not actually an LLM itself, it simply wraps around an LLM, allowing it to adapt the same functionality as the underlying LLM.

## Setup

First, you'll need a Layerup Security account from the Layerup [website](https://uselayerup.com).

Next, create a project via the [dashboard](https://dashboard.uselayerup.com), and copy your API key. We recommend putting your API key in your project's environment.

Install the Layerup Security SDK:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @layerup/layerup-security
```

And install LangChain Community:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

And now you're ready to start protecting your LLM calls with Layerup Security!

import LayerupSecurityExampleCode from "@examples/llms/layerup_security.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LayerupSecurityExampleCode}</CodeBlock>

# Llama CPP

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This module is based on the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) Node.js bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), allowing you to work with a locally running LLM. This allows you to work with a much smaller quantized model capable of running on a laptop environment, ideal for testing and scratch padding ideas without running up a bill!

## Setup

You'll need to install major version `3` of the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) module to communicate with your local model.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S node-llama-cpp@3
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You will also need a local Llama 3 model (or a model supported by [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp)). You will need to pass the path to this model to the LlamaCpp module as a part of the parameters (see example).

Out-of-the-box `node-llama-cpp` is tuned for running on a MacOS platform with support for the Metal GPU of Apple M-series of processors. If you need to turn this off or need support for the CUDA architecture then refer to the documentation at [node-llama-cpp](https://withcatai.github.io/node-llama-cpp/).

A note to LangChain.js contributors: if you want to run the tests associated with this module you will need to put the path to your local model in the environment variable `LLAMA_PATH`.

## Guide to installing Llama3

Getting a local Llama3 model running on your machine is a pre-req so this is a quick guide to getting and building Llama 3.1-8B (the smallest) and then quantizing it so that it will run comfortably on a laptop. To do this you will need `python3` on your machine (3.11 is recommended), also `gcc` and `make` so that `llama.cpp` can be built.

### Getting the Llama3 models

To get a copy of Llama3 you need to visit [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and request access to their models. Once Meta AI grant you access, you will receive an email containing a unique URL to access the files, this will be needed in the next steps.
Now create a directory to work in, for example:

```
mkdir llama3
cd llama3
```

Now we need to go to the Meta AI `llama-models` repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models). In the repo, there are instructions to download the model of your choice, and you should use the unique URL that was received in your email.
The rest of the tutorial assumes that you have downloaded `Llama3.1-8B`, but any model from here on out should work. Upon downloading the model, make sure to save the model download path, this will be used for later.

### Converting and quantizing the model

In this step we need to use `llama.cpp` so we need to download that repo.

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
```

Now we need to build the `llama.cpp` tools and set up our `python` environment. In these steps it's assumed that your install of python can be run using `python3` and that the virtual environment can be called `llama3`, adjust accordingly for your own situation.

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
python3 -m venv llama3
source llama3/bin/activate
```

After activating your llama3 environment you should see `(llama3)` prefixing your command prompt to let you know this is the active environment. Note: if you need to come back to build another model or re-quantize the model don't forget to activate the environment again also if you update `llama.cpp` you will need to rebuild the tools and possibly install new or updated dependencies! Now that we have an active python environment, we need to install the python dependencies.

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Having done this, we can start converting and quantizing the Llama3 model ready for use locally via `llama.cpp`. A conversion to a Hugging Face model is needed, followed by a conversion to a GGUF model.
First, we need to locate the path with the following script `convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py`. Copy and paste this script into your current working directory. Note that using the script may need you to pip install extra dependencies, do so as needed.
Then, we need to convert the model, prior to the conversion let's create directories to store our Hugging Face conversion and our final model.

```
mkdir models/8B
mkdir models/8B-GGUF
python3 convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --model_size 8B --input_dir <dir-to-your-model> --output_dir models/8B --llama_version 3
python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outtype f16 --outfile models/8B-GGUF/gguf-llama3-f16.bin models/8B
```

This should create a converted Hugging Face model and the final GGUF model in the directories we have created. Note that this is just a converted model so it is also around 16Gb in size, in the next step we will quantize it down to around 4Gb.

```
./build/bin/llama-quantize ./models/8B-GGUF/gguf-llama3-f16.bin ./models/8B-GGUF/gguf-llama3-Q4_0.bin Q4_0
```

Running this should result in a new model being created in the `models\8B-GGUF` directory, this one called `gguf-llama3-Q4_0.bin`, this is the model we can use with langchain. You can validate this model is working by testing it using the `llama.cpp` tools.

```
./build/bin/llama-cli -m ./models/8B-GGUF/gguf-llama3-Q4_0.bin -cnv -p "You are a helpful assistant"
```

Running this command fires up the model for a chat session. BTW if you are running out of disk space this small model is the only one we need, so you can backup and/or delete the original and converted 13.5Gb models.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import LlamaCppExample from "@examples/models/llm/llama_cpp.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LlamaCppExample}</CodeBlock>

## Streaming

import LlamaCppStreamExample from "@examples/models/llm/llama_cpp_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{LlamaCppStreamExample}</CodeBlock>;

# NIBittensor

:::warning
This module has been deprecated and is no longer supported. The documentation below will not work in versions 0.2.0 or later.
:::

LangChain.js offers experimental support for Neural Internet's Bittensor LLM models.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { NIBittensorLLM } from "langchain/experimental/llms/bittensor";

const model = new NIBittensorLLM();

const res = await model.invoke(`What is Bittensor?`);

console.log({ res });

/*
 {
 res: "\nBittensor is opensource protocol..."
 }
 */
```

# PromptLayer OpenAI

:::warning
This module has been deprecated and is no longer supported. The documentation below will not work in versions 0.2.0 or later.
:::

LangChain integrates with PromptLayer for logging and debugging prompts and responses. To add support for PromptLayer:

1. Create a PromptLayer account here: [https://promptlayer.com](https://promptlayer.com).
2. Create an API token and pass it either as `promptLayerApiKey` argument in the `PromptLayerOpenAI` constructor or in the `PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY` environment variable.

```typescript
import { PromptLayerOpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const model = new PromptLayerOpenAI({
 temperature: 0.9,
 apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
 promptLayerApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY
});
const res = await model.invoke(
 "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
```

# Azure PromptLayerOpenAI

LangChain also integrates with PromptLayer for Azure-hosted OpenAI instances:

```typescript
import { PromptLayerOpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";

const model = new PromptLayerOpenAI({
 temperature: 0.9,
 azureOpenAIApiKey: "YOUR-AOAI-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
 azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "YOUR-AOAI-INSTANCE-NAME", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME
 azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "YOUR-AOAI-DEPLOYMENT-NAME", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
 azureOpenAIApiCompletionsDeploymentName:
 "YOUR-AOAI-COMPLETIONS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_COMPLETIONS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
 azureOpenAIApiEmbeddingsDeploymentName:
 "YOUR-AOAI-EMBEDDINGS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
 azureOpenAIApiVersion: "YOUR-AOAI-API-VERSION", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
 azureOpenAIBasePath: "YOUR-AZURE-OPENAI-BASE-PATH", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH
 promptLayerApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY
});
const res = await model.invoke(
 "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
```

The request and the response will be logged in the [PromptLayer dashboard](https://promptlayer.com/home).

> **_Note:_** In streaming mode PromptLayer will not log the response.

# RaycastAI

> **Note:** This is a community-built integration and is not officially supported by Raycast.

You can utilize the LangChain's RaycastAI class within the [Raycast Environment](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/ai) to enhance your Raycast extension with Langchain's capabilities.

- The RaycastAI class is only available in the Raycast environment and only to [Raycast Pro](https://www.raycast.com/pro) users as of August 2023. You may check how to create an extension for Raycast [here](https://developers.raycast.com/).

- There is a rate limit of approx 10 requests per minute for each Raycast Pro user. If you exceed this limit, you will receive an error. You can set your desired rpm limit by passing `rateLimitPerMinute` to the `RaycastAI` constructor as shown in the example, as this rate limit may change in the future.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

```ts
import { RaycastAI } from "@langchain/community/llms/raycast";

import { Tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

const model = new RaycastAI({
 rateLimitPerMinute: 10, // It is 10 by default so you can omit this line
 model: "<model_name>",
 creativity: 0, // `creativity` is a term used by Raycast which is equivalent to `temperature` in some other LLMs
});

# Replicate

Here's an example of calling a Replicate model as an LLM:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install replicate @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import ReplicateLlama2 from "@examples/models/llm/replicate_llama2.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ReplicateLlama2}</CodeBlock>

You can run other models through Replicate by changing the `model` parameter.

You can find a full list of models on [Replicate's website](https://replicate.com/explore).

# Writer

LangChain.js supports calling [Writer](https://writer.com/) LLMs.

## Setup

First, you'll need to sign up for an account at https://writer.com/. Create a service account and note your API key.

Next, you'll need to install the official package as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add @writerai/writer-sdk
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import WriterExample from "@examples/models/llm/writer.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{WriterExample}</CodeBlock>

# YandexGPT

LangChain.js supports calling [YandexGPT](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/services/yandexgpt) LLMs.

## Setup

First, you should [create service account](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/sa/create) with the `ai.languageModels.user` role.

Next, you have two authentication options:

- [IAM token](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa).
 You can specify the token in a constructor parameter `iam_token` or in an environment variable `YC_IAM_TOKEN`.
- [API key](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/operations/api-key/create)
 You can specify the key in a constructor parameter `api_key` or in an environment variable `YC_API_KEY`.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/yandex @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

# Astra DB Chat Memory

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for Astra DB.

## Setup

You need to install the Astra DB TS client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @datastax/astra-db-ts
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Configuration and Initalization

There are two ways to inialize your `AstraDBChatMessageHistory`

If you already have an instance of the `AstraDB` client defined you can connect to your collection and initialize an instance of the `ChatMessageHistory` using the constuctor.

```typescript
const client = (client = new AstraDB(
 process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN,
 process.env.ASTRA_DB_ENDPOINT,
 process.env.ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE
));

const collection = await client.collection("YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME");

const chatHistory = new AstraDBChatMessageHistory({
 collection,
 sessionId: "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
});
```

If you don't already have an instance of an `AstraDB` client you can use the `initialize` method.

```typescript
const chatHistory = await AstraDBChatMessageHistory.initialize({
 token: process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN ?? "token",
 endpoint: process.env.ASTRA_DB_ENDPOINT ?? "endpoint",
 namespace: process.env.ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE,
 collectionName: "YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME",
 sessionId: "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
});
```

## Usage

:::tip Tip
Your collection must already exist

# Azure Cosmos DB Mongo vCore Chat Message History

The AzureCosmosDBMongoChatMessageHistory uses Azure Cosmos DB Mongo vCore to store chat message history. For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory`.
If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-cosmosdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-cosmosdb) package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/azure-cosmosdb @langchain/core
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to have an Azure Cosmos DB mongo vCore instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost, following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/quickstart-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the connection string.

## Usage

# Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Chat Message History

The AzureCosmosDBNoSQLChatMessageHistory uses Cosmos DB to store chat message history. For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory`.
If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-cosmosdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-cosmosdb) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to have an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost, following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the connection string. If you are using Managed Identity, you need to have the endpoint. You can find them in the Azure Portal, under the "Settings / Keys" section of your instance.

:::info

When using Azure Managed Identity and role-based access control, you must ensure that the database and container have been created beforehand. RBAC does not provide permissions to create databases and containers. You can get more information about the permission model in the [Azure Cosmos DB documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#permission-model).

# Cassandra Chat Memory

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a Cassandra cluster.

## Setup

First, install the Cassandra Node.js driver:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cassandra-driver @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Depending on your database providers, the specifics of how to connect to the database will vary. We will create a document `configConnection` which will be used as part of the vector store configuration.

### Apache Cassandra®

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 contactPoints: ['h1', 'h2'],
 localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',
 credentials: {
 username: <...> as string,
 password: <...> as string,
 },
};
```

### Astra DB

Astra DB is a cloud-native Cassandra-as-a-Service platform.

1. Create an [Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/register).
2. Create a [vector enabled database](https://astra.datastax.com/createDatabase).
3. Create a [token](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) for your database.

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 serviceProviderArgs: {
 astra: {
 token: <...> as string,
 endpoint: <...> as string,
 },
 },
};
```

Instead of `endpoint:`, you many provide property `datacenterID:` and optionally `regionName:`.

# Cloudflare D1-Backed Chat Memory

:::info
This integration is only supported in Cloudflare Workers.
:::

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a Cloudflare D1 instance.

## Setup

You'll need to install the LangChain Cloudflare integration package.
For the below example, we also use Anthropic, but you can use any model you'd like:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/cloudflare @langchain/anthropic @langchain/core
```

Set up a D1 instance for your worker by following [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). Your project's `wrangler.toml` file should
look something like this:

```toml
name = "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-10"

[vars]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # available in your Worker as env.DB
database_name = "YOUR_D1_DB_NAME"
database_id = "YOUR_D1_DB_ID"
```

## Usage

You can then use D1 to store your history as follows:

# Convex Chat Memory

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for [Convex](https://convex.dev/).

## Setup

### Create project

Get a working [Convex](https://docs.convex.dev/) project set up, for example by using:

```bash
npm create convex@latest
```

### Add database accessors

Add query and mutation helpers to `convex/langchain/db.ts`:

```ts title="convex/langchain/db.ts"
export * from "@langchain/community/utils/convex";
```

### Configure your schema

Set up your schema (for indexing):

```ts title="convex/schema.ts"
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
 messages: defineTable({
 sessionId: v.string(),
 message: v.object({
 type: v.string(),
 data: v.object({
 content: v.string(),
 role: v.optional(v.string()),
 name: v.optional(v.string()),
 additional_kwargs: v.optional(v.any()),
 }),
 }),
 }).index("bySessionId", ["sessionId"]),
});
```

## Usage

Each chat history session stored in Convex must have a unique session id.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core

# DynamoDB-Backed Chat Memory

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a DynamoDB instance.

## Setup

First, install the AWS DynamoDB client in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Next, sign into your AWS account and create a DynamoDB table. Name the table `langchain`, and name your partition key `id`. Make sure your partition key is a string. You can leave sort key and the other settings alone.

You'll also need to retrieve an AWS access key and secret key for a role or user that has access to the table and add them to your environment variables.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

# Firestore Chat Memory

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a firestore.

## Setup

First, install the Firebase admin package in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install firebase-admin
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Visit the `Project Settings` page from your Firebase project and select the `Service accounts` tab.

Inside the `Service accounts` tab, click the `Generate new private key` button inside the `Firebase Admin SDK` section to download a JSON file containing your service account's credentials.

Using the downloaded JSON file, pass in the `projectId`, `privateKey`, and `clientEmail` to the `config` object of the `FirestoreChatMessageHistory` class, like shown below:

```typescript
import { FirestoreChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/community/stores/message/firestore";
import admin from "firebase-admin";

const messageHistory = new FirestoreChatMessageHistory({
 collections: ["chats"],
 docs: ["user-id"],
 sessionId: "user-id",
 userId: "a@example.com",
 config: {
 projectId: "YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
 credential: admin.credential.cert({
 projectId: "YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
 privateKey:
 "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nCHANGE-ME\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
 clientEmail: "CHANGE-ME@CHANGE-ME-TOO.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
 }),
 },
});
```

Here, the `collections` field should match the names and ordering of the `collections` in your database.
The same goes for `docs`, it should match the names and ordering of the `docs` in your database.

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/memory/firestore.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

### Nested Collections

The `FirestoreChatMessageHistory` class supports nested collections, and dynamic collection/doc names.

The example below shows how to add and retrieve messages from a database with the following structure:

```
/chats/{chat-id}/bots/{bot-id}/messages/{message-id}
```

import NestedExample from "@examples/memory/firestore_nested.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{NestedExample}</CodeBlock>

## Firestore Rules

If your collection name is "chathistory," you can configure Firestore rules as follows.

```
 match /chathistory/{sessionId} {
 allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
 allow write: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.createdBy;
 }
 match /chathistory/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId} {
 allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
 allow write: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.createdBy;
 }
```
```

# Momento-Backed Chat Memory

For distributed, serverless persistence across chat sessions, you can swap in a [Momento](https://gomomento.com/)-backed chat message history.
Because a Momento cache is instantly available and requires zero infrastructure maintenance, it's a great way to get started with chat history whether building locally or in production.

## Setup

You will need to install the [Momento Client Library](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript) in your project. Given Momento's compatibility with Node.js, browser, and edge environments, ensure you install the relevant package.

To install for **Node.js**:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @gomomento/sdk
```

To install for **browser/edge workers**:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @gomomento/sdk-web
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You will also need an API key from [Momento](https://gomomento.com/). You can sign up for a free account [here](https://console.gomomento.com/).

## Usage

To distinguish one chat history session from another, we need a unique `sessionId`. You may also provide an optional `sessionTtl` to make sessions expire after a given number of seconds.

import MomentoExample from "@examples/memory/momento.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MomentoExample}</CodeBlock>

You will also need an Upstash Account and a Redis database to connect to. See instructions on [Upstash Docs](https://docs.upstash.com/redis) on how to create a HTTP client.

## Usage

Each chat history session stored in Redis must have a unique id. You can provide an optional `sessionTTL` to make sessions expire after a give number of seconds.
The `config` parameter is passed directly into the `new Redis()` constructor of [@upstash/redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/javascriptsdk/overview), and takes all the same arguments.

import Example from "@examples/memory/upstash_redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Advanced Usage

You can also directly pass in a previously created [@upstash/redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/javascriptsdk/overview) client instance:

import AdvancedExample from "@examples/memory/upstash_redis_advanced.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AdvancedExample}</CodeBlock>

# Xata Chat Memory

[Xata](https://xata.io) is a serverless data platform, based on PostgreSQL. It provides a type-safe TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for interacting with your database, and a
UI for managing your data.

With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions.

Because Xata works via a REST API and has a pure TypeScript SDK, you can use this with [Vercel Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime), [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and any other Serverless environment.

## Setup

### Install the Xata CLI

```bash
npm install @xata.io/cli -g
```

### Create a database to be used as a vector store

In the [Xata UI](https://app.xata.io) create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, but for this example we'll use `langchain`.

When executed for the first time, the Xata LangChain integration will create the table used for storing the chat messages. If a table with that name already exists, it will be left untouched.

### Initialize the project

In your project, run:

```bash
xata init
```

and then choose the database you created above. This will also generate a `xata.ts` or `xata.js` file that defines the client you can use to interact with the database. See the [Xata getting started docs](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/installation) for more details on using the Xata JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Each chat history session stored in Xata database must have a unique id.

In this example, the `getXataClient()` function is used to create a new Xata client based on the environment variables. However, we recommend using the code generated by the `xata init` command, in which case you only need to import the `getXataClient()` function from the generated `xata.ts` file.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import Example from "@examples/memory/xata.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

### With pre-created table

If you don't want the code to always check if the table exists, you can create the table manually in the Xata UI and pass `createTable: false` to the constructor. The table must have the following columns:

- `sessionId` of type `String`
- `type` of type `String`
- `role` of type `String`
- `content` of type `Text`
- `name` of type `String`
- `additionalKwargs` of type `Text`

# Zep Cloud Memory

> Recall, understand, and extract data from chat histories. Power personalized AI experiences.

> [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
> With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
> while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

## How Zep Cloud works

Zep persists and recalls chat histories, and automatically generates summaries and other artifacts from these chat histories.
It also embeds messages and summaries, enabling you to search Zep for relevant context from past conversations.
Zep does all of this asynchronously, ensuring these operations don't impact your user's chat experience.
Data is persisted to database, allowing you to scale out when growth demands.

Zep also provides a simple, easy to use abstraction for document vector search called Document Collections.
This is designed to complement Zep's core memory features, but is not designed to be a general purpose vector database.

Zep allows you to be more intentional about constructing your prompt:

- automatically adding a few recent messages, with the number customized for your app;
- a summary of recent conversations prior to the messages above;
- and/or contextually relevant summaries or messages surfaced from the entire chat session.
- and/or relevant Business data from Zep Document Collections.

Zep Cloud offers:

- **Fact Extraction**: Automatically build fact tables from conversations, without having to define a data schema upfront.
- **Dialog Classification**: Instantly and accurately classify chat dialog. Understand user intent and emotion, segment users, and more. Route chains based on semantic context, and trigger events.
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Quickly extract business data from chat conversations using a schema you define. Understand what your Assistant should ask for next in order to complete its task.

## Installation

Sign up for [Zep Cloud](https://app.getzep.com/) and create a project.

Follow the [Zep Cloud Typescript SDK Installation Guide](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) to install and get started with Zep.

You'll need your Zep Cloud Project API Key to use the Zep Cloud Memory. See the [Zep Cloud docs](https://help.getzep.com/projects) for more information.

# Anthropic

All functionality related to Anthropic models.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude.
This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain.

## Prompting Best Practices

Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models.

**System Messages may only be the first message**

Anthropic models require any system messages to be the first one in your prompts.

## `ChatAnthropic`

`ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain's `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`.
You can import this wrapper with the following code:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
const model = new ChatAnthropic({});
```

When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s.
Here is an example below of doing that:

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
 ["system", "You are a helpful chatbot"],
 ["human", "Tell me a joke about {topic}"],
]);
```

You can then use this in a chain as follows:

```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
await chain.invoke({ topic: "bears" });
```

See the [chat model integration page](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic/) for more examples, including multimodal inputs.

Functionality related to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

## Chat models

### Gemini Models

Access Gemini models such as `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-1.5-flex` through the [`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`](/docs/integrations/chat/google_generativeai),
or if using VertexAI, via the [`ChatVertexAI`](/docs/integrations/chat/google_vertex_ai) class.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="genai" label="GenAI" default>
<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-genai @langchain/core
```

Configure your API key.

```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

```typescript
import { ChatGoogleGenerativeAI } from "@langchain/google-genai";

const model = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
 model: "gemini-pro",
 maxOutputTokens: 2048,
});

// Batch and stream are also supported
const res = await model.invoke([
 [
 "human",
 "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?",
 ],
]);
```

Gemini vision models support image inputs when providing a single human message. For example:

```typescript
const visionModel = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
 model: "gemini-pro-vision",
 maxOutputTokens: 2048,
});
const image = fs.readFileSync("./hotdog.jpg").toString("base64");
const input2 = [
 new HumanMessage({
 content: [
 {
 type: "text",
 text: "Describe the following image.",
 },
 {
 type: "image_url",
 image_url: `data:image/png;base64,${image}`,
 },
 ],
 }),
];

const res = await visionModel.invoke(input2);
```

:::tip

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vertexai" label="VertexAI" default>
<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-vertexai @langchain/core
```

Then, you'll need to add your service account credentials, either directly as a `GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

```
GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"YOUR_PROJECT-12345",...}
```

or as a file path:

```
GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/your/credentials.json
```

```typescript
import { ChatVertexAI } from "@langchain/google-vertexai";
// Or, if using the web entrypoint:
// import { ChatVertexAI } from "@langchain/google-vertexai-web";

const model = new ChatVertexAI({
 model: "gemini-1.0-pro",
 maxOutputTokens: 2048,
});

// Batch and stream are also supported
const res = await model.invoke([
 [
 "human",
 "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?",
 ],
]);
```

Gemini vision models support image inputs when providing a single human message. For example:

```typescript
const visionModel = new ChatVertexAI({
 model: "gemini-pro-vision",
 maxOutputTokens: 2048,
});
const image = fs.readFileSync("./hotdog.png").toString("base64");
const input2 = [
 new HumanMessage({
 content: [
 {
 type: "text",
 text: "Describe the following image.",
 },
 {
 type: "image_url",
 image_url: `data:image/png;base64,${image}`,
 },
 ],
 }),
];

const res = await visionModel.invoke(input2);
```

:::tip
Click [here](/docs/integrations/chat/google_vertex_ai) for the `@langchain/google-vertexai` specific integration docs
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The value of `image_url` must be a base64 encoded image (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,abcd124`).

### Non-Gemini Models

See above for setting up authentication through Vertex AI to use these models.

[Anthropic](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic) Claude models are also available through
the [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude)
platform. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude)
for more information about enabling access to the models and the model names to use.

PaLM models are no longer supported.

## Vector Store

### Vertex AI Vector Search

> [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview),
> formerly known as Vertex AI Matching Engine, provides the industry's leading high-scale
> low latency vector database. These vector databases are commonly
> referred to as vector similarity-matching or an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) service.

```typescript
import { MatchingEngine } from "langchain/vectorstores/googlevertexai";
```

## Tools

### Google Search

- Set up a Custom Search Engine, following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)
- Get an API Key and Custom Search Engine ID from the previous step, and set them as environment variables `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` respectively

There exists a `GoogleCustomSearch` utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```typescript
import { GoogleCustomSearch } from "langchain/tools";
```

We can easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent). We can do this with:

```typescript
const tools = [new GoogleCustomSearch({})];
// Pass this variable into your agent.
```
```

## Document loaders

### Azure Blob Storage

> [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

> [Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) offers fully managed
> file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (`SMB`) protocol,
> Network File System (`NFS`) protocol, and `Azure Files REST API`. `Azure Files` are based on the `Azure Blob Storage`.

`Azure Blob Storage` is designed for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Writing to log files.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

# ArxivRetriever

The `arXiv Retriever` allows users to query the arXiv database for academic articles. It supports both full-document retrieval (PDF parsing) and summary-based retrieval.

For detailed documentation of all ArxivRetriever features and configurations, head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_community.retrievers_arxiv.ArxivRetriever.html)

## Features

- Query Flexibility: Search using natural language queries or specific arXiv IDs.
- Full-Document Retrieval: Option to fetch and parse PDFs.
- Summaries as Documents: Retrieve summaries for faster results.
- Customizable Options: Configure maximum results and output format.

## Integration details

| Retriever | Source | Package |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArxivRetriever` | Academic articles from arXiv | [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) |

## Setup

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `pdf-parse` for parsing PDFs
- `fast-xml-parser` for parsing XML responses from the arXiv API

```npm2yarn
npm install pdf-parse fast-xml-parser
```

## Instantiation

```typescript
const retriever = new ArxivRetriever({
 getFullDocuments: false, // Set to true to fetch full documents (PDFs)
 maxSearchResults: 5, // Maximum number of results to retrieve
});
```

## Usage

Use the `invoke` method to search arXiv for relevant articles. You can use either natural language queries or specific arXiv IDs.

```typescript
const query = "quantum computing";

const documents = await retriever.invoke(query);
documents.forEach((doc) => {
 console.log("Title:", doc.metadata.title);
 console.log("Content:", doc.pageContent); // Parsed PDF content
});
```

## Use within a chain

Like other retrievers, `ArxivRetriever` can be incorporated into LLM applications via chains. Below is an example of using the retriever within a chain:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import {
 RunnablePassthrough,
 RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
 model: "gpt-4o-mini",
 temperature: 0,
});

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
Answer the question based only on the context provided.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}`);

const formatDocs = (docs: Document[]) => {
 return docs.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join("\n\n");
};

const ragChain = RunnableSequence.from([
 {
 context: retriever.pipe(formatDocs),
 question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
 },
 prompt,
 llm,
 new StringOutputParser(),
]);

await ragChain.invoke("What are the latest advances in quantum computing?");
```

# Dria Retriever

The [Dria](https://dria.co/profile) retriever allows an agent to perform a text-based search across a comprehensive knowledge hub.

## Setup

To use Dria retriever, first install Dria JS client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install dria
```

You need to provide two things to the retriever:

- **API Key**: you can get yours at your [profile page](https://dria.co/profile) when you create an account.
- **Contract ID**: accessible at the top of the page when viewing a knowledge or in its URL.
 For example, the Bitcoin whitepaper is uploaded on Dria at https://dria.co/knowledge/2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0, so its contract ID is `2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0`.
 Contract ID can be omitted during instantiation, and later be set via `dria.contractId = "your-contract"`

Dria retriever exposes the underlying [Dria client](https://npmjs.com/package/dria) as well, refer to the [Dria documentation](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dria-js-client?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to learn more about the client.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install dria @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/dria.ts";

# HyDE Retriever

This example shows how to use the HyDE Retriever, which implements Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496).

At a high level, HyDE is an embedding technique that takes queries, generates a hypothetical answer, and then embeds that generated document and uses that as the final example.

In order to use HyDE, we therefore need to provide a base embedding model, as well as an LLM that can be used to generate those documents. By default, the HyDE class comes with some default prompts to use (see the paper for more details on them), but we can also create our own, which should have a single input variable `{question}`.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/hyde.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Retrievers

A [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers) is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query.
It is more general than a vector store.
A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them.

Retrievers accept a string query as input and return a list of Documents.

For specifics on how to use retrievers, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#retrievers).

Note that all [vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores) can be [cast to retrievers](/docs/how_to/vectorstore_retriever/).
Refer to the vector store [integration docs](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) for available vector store retrievers.

:::info
If you'd like to write your own retriever, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).

# Supabase Hybrid Search

Langchain supports hybrid search with a Supabase Postgres database. The hybrid search combines the postgres `pgvector` extension (similarity search) and Full-Text Search (keyword search) to retrieve documents. You can add documents via SupabaseVectorStore `addDocuments` function. SupabaseHybridKeyWordSearch accepts embedding, supabase client, number of results for similarity search, and number of results for keyword search as parameters. The `getRelevantDocuments` function produces a list of documents that has duplicates removed and is sorted by relevance score.

## Setup

### Install the library with

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Create a table and search functions in your database

Run this in your database:

```sql
-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
create extension vector;

-- Create a table to store your documents
create table documents (
 id bigserial primary key,
 content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent
 metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata
 embedding vector(1536) -- 1536 works for OpenAI embeddings, change if needed
);

-- Create a function to similarity search for documents
create function match_documents (
 query_embedding vector(1536),
 match_count int DEFAULT null,
 filter jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
) returns table (
 id bigint,
 content text,
 metadata jsonb,
 similarity float
)
language plpgsql
as $$
#variable_conflict use_column
begin
 return query
 select
 id,
 content,
 metadata,
 1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
 from documents
 where metadata @> filter
 order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
 limit match_count;
end;
$$;

-- Create a function to keyword search for documents
create function kw_match_documents(query_text text, match_count int)
returns table (id bigint, content text, metadata jsonb, similarity real)
as $$

begin
return query execute
format('select id, content, metadata, ts_rank(to_tsvector(content), plainto_tsquery($1)) as similarity
from documents
where to_tsvector(content) @@ plainto_tsquery($1)
order by similarity desc
limit $2')
using query_text, match_count;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/supabase_hybrid.ts";

# Time-Weighted Retriever

A Time-Weighted Retriever is a retriever that takes into account recency in addition to similarity. The scoring algorithm is:

```typescript
let score = (1.0 - this.decayRate) ** hoursPassed + vectorRelevance;
```

Notably, `hoursPassed` above refers to the time since the object in the retriever was last accessed, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain "fresh" and score higher.

`this.decayRate` is a configurable decimal number between 0 and 1. A lower number means that documents will be "remembered" for longer, while a higher number strongly weights more recently accessed documents.

Note that setting a decay rate of exactly 0 or 1 makes `hoursPassed` irrelevant and makes this retriever equivalent to a standard vector lookup.

## Usage

This example shows how to intialize a `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` with a vector store.
It is important to note that due to required metadata, all documents must be added to the backing vector store using the `addDocuments` method on the **retriever**, not the vector store itself.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/time-weighted-retriever.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Vespa Retriever

This shows how to use Vespa.ai as a LangChain retriever.
Vespa.ai is a platform for highly efficient structured text and vector search.
Please refer to [Vespa.ai](https://vespa.ai) for more information.

The following sets up a retriever that fetches results from Vespa's documentation search:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/vespa.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Here, up to 5 results are retrieved from the `content` field in the `paragraph` document type,
using `documentation` as the ranking method. The `userQuery()` is replaced with the actual query
passed from LangChain.

Please refer to the [pyvespa documentation](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-pyvespa.html#Query)
for more information.

The URL is the endpoint of the Vespa application.
You can connect to any Vespa endpoint, either a remote service or a local instance using Docker.
However, most Vespa Cloud instances are protected with mTLS.
If this is your case, you can, for instance set up a [CloudFlare Worker](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/security/cloudflare-workers)
that contains the necessary credentials to connect to the instance.

Now you can return the results and continue using them in LangChain.

 "# In-memory\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide will help you getting started with such a retriever backed by an [in-memory vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/memory). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_self_query.SelfQueryRetriever.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "A [self-query retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retrieves documents by dynamically generating metadata filters based on some input query. This allows the retriever to account for underlying document metadata in addition to pure semantic similarity when fetching results.\n",
 "\n",
 "It uses a module called a `Translator` that generates a filter based on information about metadata fields and the query language that a given vector store supports.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Integration details\n",
 "\n",
 "| Backing vector store | Self-host | Cloud offering | Package | Py support |\n",
 "| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",

 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "Set up an in-memory vector store instance as documented [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/memory).\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY = \"<YOUR API KEY HERE>\";\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING = \"true\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The vector store lives in the `@langchain/community` package. You'll also need to install the `langchain` package to import the main `SelfQueryRetriever` class.\n",
 "\n",
 "For this example, we'll also use OpenAI embeddings, so you'll need to install the `@langchain/openai` package and [obtain an API key](https://platform.openai.com):\n",

 "\n",
 "This guide will help you getting started with such a retriever backed by a [Pinecone vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_self_query.SelfQueryRetriever.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "A [self-query retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retrieves documents by dynamically generating metadata filters based on some input query. This allows the retriever to account for underlying document metadata in addition to pure semantic similarity when fetching results.\n",
 "\n",
 "It uses a module called a `Translator` that generates a filter based on information about metadata fields and the query language that a given vector store supports.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Integration details\n",
 "\n",
 "| Backing vector store | Self-host | Cloud offering | Package | [Py support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/pinecone/) |\n",

 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "Set up a Pinecone instance as documented [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone). Set the following environment variables:\n",
 "\n",
 "```ts\n",
 "process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\";\n",
 "process.env.PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = \"YOUR_ENVIRONMENT\";\n",
 "process.env.PINECONE_INDEX = \"YOUR_INDEX\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY = \"<YOUR API KEY HERE>\";\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING = \"true\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The vector store lives in the `@langchain/pinecone` package. You'll also need to install the `langchain` package to import the main `SelfQueryRetriever` class.\n",
 "\n",
 "The official Pinecone SDK (`@pinecone-database/pinecone`) is automatically installed as a dependency of `@langchain/pinecone`, but you may wish to install it independently as well.\n",

 "\n",
 "This guide will help you getting started with such a retriever backed by a [Supabase vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_self_query.SelfQueryRetriever.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "A [self-query retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retrieves documents by dynamically generating metadata filters based on some input query. This allows the retriever to account for underlying document metadata in addition to pure semantic similarity when fetching results.\n",
 "\n",
 "It uses a module called a `Translator` that generates a filter based on information about metadata fields and the query language that a given vector store supports.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Integration details\n",
 "\n",
 "| Backing vector store | Self-host | Cloud offering | Package | [Py support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/supabase_self_query/) |\n",

 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "Set up a Supabase instance as documented [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase). Set the following environment variables:\n",
 "\n",
 "```ts\n",
 "process.env.SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY = \"YOUR_SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY\";\n",
 "process.env.SUPABASE_URL = \"YOUR_SUPABASE_URL\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY = \"<YOUR API KEY HERE>\";\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING = \"true\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The vector store lives in the `@langchain/community` package, which requires the official Supabase SDK as a peer dependency. You'll also need to install the `langchain` package to import the main `SelfQueryRetriever` class.\n",
 "\n",
 "For this example, we'll also use OpenAI embeddings, so you'll need to install the `@langchain/openai` package and [obtain an API key](https://platform.openai.com):\n",

 "# Weaviate\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide will help you getting started with such a retriever backed by a [Weaviate vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_self_query.SelfQueryRetriever.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "A [self-query retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retrieves documents by dynamically generating metadata filters based on some input query. This allows the retriever to account for underlying document metadata in addition to pure semantic similarity when fetching results.\n",
 "\n",
 "It uses a module called a `Translator` that generates a filter based on information about metadata fields and the query language that a given vector store supports.\n",

# Cassandra KV

This example demonstrates how to setup chat history storage using the `CassandraKVStore` `BaseStore` integration. Note there is a `CassandraChatMessageHistory`
integration which may be easier to use for chat history storage; the `CassandraKVStore` is useful if you want a more general-purpose key-value store with
prefixable keys.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core cassandra-driver
```

Depending on your database providers, the specifics of how to connect to the database will vary. We will create a document `configConnection` which will be used as part of the store configuration.

### Apache Cassandra®

Storage Attached Indexes (used by `yieldKeys`) are supported in [Apache Cassandra® 5.0](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Apache-Cassandra-5.0-Features-Storage-Attached-Indexes.html) and above. You can use a standard connection document, for example:

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 contactPoints: ['h1', 'h2'],
 localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',
 credentials: {
 username: <...> as string,
 password: <...> as string,
 },
};
```

### Astra DB

Astra DB is a cloud-native Cassandra-as-a-Service platform.

1. Create an [Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/register).
2. Create a [vector enabled database](https://astra.datastax.com/createDatabase).
3. Create a [token](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) for your database.

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 serviceProviderArgs: {
 astra: {
 token: <...> as string,
 endpoint: <...> as string,
 },
 },
};
```

Instead of `endpoint:`, you many provide property `datacenterID:` and optionally `regionName:`.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/stores/cassandra_storage.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import AlibabaTongyiExample from "@examples/embeddings/alibaba_tongyi.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AlibabaTongyiExample}</CodeBlock>

 "[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) is a cloud service to help you quickly develop generative AI experiences with a diverse set of prebuilt and curated models from OpenAI, Meta and beyond.\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain.js supports integration with [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/) using the new Azure integration in the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node).\n",
 "\n",
 "You can learn more about Azure OpenAI and its difference with the OpenAI API on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.\n",
 "\n",
 "This will help you get started with AzureOpenAIEmbeddings [embedding models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `AzureOpenAIEmbeddings` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_openai.AzureOpenAIEmbeddings.html).\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info\n",
 "\n",
 "Previously, LangChain.js supported integration with Azure OpenAI using the dedicated [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai). This SDK is now deprecated in favor of the new Azure integration in the OpenAI SDK, which allows to access the latest OpenAI models and features the same day they are released, and allows seamless transition between the OpenAI API and Azure OpenAI.\n",
 "\n",
 "If you are using Azure OpenAI with the deprecated SDK, see the [migration guide](#migration-from-azure-openai-sdk) to update to the new API.\n",

 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "To access Azure OpenAI embedding models you'll need to create an Azure account, get an API key, and install the `@langchain/openai` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "You'll need to have an Azure OpenAI instance deployed. You can deploy a version on Azure Portal following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).\n",
 "\n",
 "Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the name of your instance and key. You can find the key in the Azure Portal, under the \"Keys and Endpoint\" section of your instance.\n",
 "\n",
 "If you're using Node.js, you can define the following environment variables to use the service:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME=<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME>\n",
 "AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<YOUR_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>\n",
 "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>\n",
 "AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=\"2024-02-01\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangChain AzureOpenAIEmbeddings integration lives in the `@langchain/openai` package:\n",

 "\n",
 "If `AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` is not defined, it will fall back to the value of `AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` for the deployment name. The same applies to the `azureOpenAIApiEmbeddingsDeploymentName` parameter in the `AzureOpenAIEmbeddings` constructor, which will fall back to the value of `azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName` if not defined.\n",

# Baidu Qianfan

The `BaiduQianfanEmbeddings` class uses the Baidu Qianfan API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

An API key is required to use this embedding model. You can get one by registering at https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/s/alj562vvu.

Please set the acquired API key as an environment variable named BAIDU_API_KEY, and set your secret key as an environment variable named BAIDU_SECRET_KEY.

Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/baidu-qianfan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/baidu-qianfan) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/baidu-qianfan @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import BaiduQianFanExample from "@examples/embeddings/baidu_qianfan.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BaiduQianFanExample}</CodeBlock>

 "\n",
 "You'll need to sign up for an [ARK API key](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/apiKey) and set it as an environment variable named `ARK_API_KEY`. Then you should [create a entrypoint](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/endpoint) for embedding models, and use the entrypoint's name as `model`.\n",
 "\n",
 "Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package\n",

 "# export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",

# DeepInfra Embeddings

The `DeepInfraEmbeddings` class utilizes the DeepInfra API to generate embeddings for given text inputs. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of the `DeepInfraEmbeddings` class, helping you integrate it into your project seamlessly.

## Installation

Install the `@langchain/community` package as shown below:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Initialization

With this integration, you can use the DeepInfra embeddings model to get embeddings for your text data. Here is the [link](https://deepinfra.com/models/embeddings) to the embeddings models.

First, you need to sign up on the DeepInfra website and get the API token from [here](https://deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys). You can copy names from the model cards and start using them in your code.

To use the `DeepInfraEmbeddings` class, you need an API token from DeepInfra. You can pass this token directly to the constructor or set it as an environment variable (`DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`).

### Basic Usage

Here’s how to create an instance of `DeepInfraEmbeddings`:

```typescript
import { DeepInfraEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/deepinfra";

const embeddings = new DeepInfraEmbeddings({
 apiToken: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
 modelName: "sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32", // Optional, defaults to "sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32"
 batchSize: 1024, // Optional, defaults to 1024
});
```

If the `apiToken` is not provided, it will be read from the `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Generating Embeddings

### Embedding a Single Query

To generate embeddings for a single text query, use the `embedQuery` method:

```typescript
const embedding = await embeddings.embedQuery(
 "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log(embedding);
```

### Embedding Multiple Documents

To generate embeddings for multiple documents, use the `embedDocuments` method. This method will handle batching automatically based on the `batchSize` parameter:

```typescript
const documents = [
 "Document 1 text...",
 "Document 2 text...",
 "Document 3 text...",
];

const embeddingsArray = await embeddings.embedDocuments(documents);
console.log(embeddingsArray);
```

## Customizing Requests

You can customize the base URL the SDK sends requests to by passing a `configuration` parameter:

```typescript
const customEmbeddings = new DeepInfraEmbeddings({
 apiToken: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
 configuration: {
 baseURL: "https://your_custom_url.com",
 },
});
```

This allows you to route requests through a custom endpoint if needed.

## Error Handling

If the API token is not provided and cannot be found in the environment variables, an error will be thrown:

```typescript
try {
 const embeddings = new DeepInfraEmbeddings();
} catch (error) {
 console.error("DeepInfra API token not found");
}
```

## Example

Here’s a complete example of how to set up and use the `DeepInfraEmbeddings` class:

```typescript
import { DeepInfraEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/deepinfra";

const embeddings = new DeepInfraEmbeddings({
 apiToken: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
 modelName: "sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32",
 batchSize: 512,
});

async function runExample() {
 const queryEmbedding = await embeddings.embedQuery("Example query text.");
 console.log("Query Embedding:", queryEmbedding);

 const documents = ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"];
 const documentEmbeddings = await embeddings.embedDocuments(documents);
 console.log("Document Embeddings:", documentEmbeddings);
}

runExample();
```

 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain.js supports two different authentication methods based on whether\n",
 "you're running in a Node.js environment or a web environment.\n",
 "\n",
 "To access `ChatVertexAI` models you'll need to setup Google VertexAI in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, save the credentials file, and install the `@langchain/google-vertexai` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "Head to your [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and generate a credentials file. Once you've done this set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"path/to/your/credentials.json\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If running in a web environment, you should set the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable as a JSON stringified object, and install the `@langchain/google-vertexai-web` package:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS={\"type\":\"service_account\",\"project_id\":\"YOUR_PROJECT-12345\",...}\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "The LangChain `VertexAIEmbeddings` integration lives in the `@langchain/google-vertexai` package:\n",

# Gradient AI

The `GradientEmbeddings` class uses the Gradient AI API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

You'll need to install the official Gradient Node SDK as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @langchain/community @langchain/core @gradientai/nodejs-sdk
```

You will need to set the following environment variables for using the Gradient AI API.

```
export GRADIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
export GRADIENT_WORKSPACE_ID=<YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID>
```

Alternatively, these can be set during the GradientAI Class instantiation as `gradientAccessKey` and `workspaceId` respectively.
For example:

```typescript
const model = new GradientEmbeddings({
 gradientAccessKey: "My secret Access Token"
 workspaceId: "My secret workspace id"
});
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import GradientEmbeddingsExample from "@examples/embeddings/gradient_ai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GradientEmbeddingsExample}</CodeBlock>

# HuggingFace Inference

This Embeddings integration uses the HuggingFace Inference API to generate embeddings for a given text using by default the `sentence-transformers/distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens` model. You can pass a different model name to the constructor to use a different model.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package and the required peer dep:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @huggingface/inference@2
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { HuggingFaceInferenceEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/hf";

const embeddings = new HuggingFaceInferenceEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_KEY
});
```

# Embeddings

[Embedding models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) create a vector representation of a piece of text.

This page documents integrations with various model providers that allow you to use embeddings in LangChain.

import EmbeddingTabs from "@theme/EmbeddingTabs";

<EmbeddingTabs />

```javascript
await embeddings.embedQuery("Hello, world!");
```

import { CategoryTable, IndexTable } from "@theme/FeatureTables";

# Jina Embeddings

The `JinaEmbeddings` class utilizes the Jina API to generate embeddings for given text inputs. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of the `JinaEmbeddings` class, helping you integrate it into your project seamlessly.

## Installation

Install the `@langchain/community` package as shown below:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Initialization

With this integration, you can use the Jina embeddings model to get embeddings for your text data. Here is the [link](https://jina.ai/embeddings) to the embeddings models.

First, you need to sign up on the Jina website and get the API token from [here](https://jina.ai/embeddings). You can copy model names from the dropdown in the api playground.

To use the `JinaEmbeddings` class, you need an API token from Jina. You can pass this token directly to the constructor or set it as an environment variable (`JINA_API_KEY`).

### Basic Usage

Here’s how to create an instance of `JinaEmbeddings`:

```typescript
import { JinaEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/jina";

const embeddings = new JinaEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
 model: "jina-clip-v2", // Optional, defaults to "jina-clip-v2"
});
```

If the `apiKey` is not provided, it will be read from the `JINA_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Generating Embeddings

### Embedding a Single Query

To generate embeddings for a single text query, use the `embedQuery` method:

```typescript
const embedding = await embeddings.embedQuery(
 "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log(embedding);
```

### Embedding Multiple Documents

To generate embeddings for multiple documents, use the `embedDocuments` method.

```typescript
import { localImageToBase64 } from "@langchain/community/utils/local_image_to_base64";
const documents = [
 "hello",
 {
 text: "hello",
 },
 {
 image: "https://i.ibb.co/nQNGqL0/beach1.jpg",
 },
 {
 image: await localImageToBase64("beach1.jpg"),
 },
];

const embeddingsArray = await embeddings.embedDocuments(documents);
console.log(embeddingsArray);
```

## Error Handling

If the API token is not provided and cannot be found in the environment variables, an error will be thrown:

```typescript
try {
 const embeddings = new JinaEmbeddings();
} catch (error) {
 console.error("Jina API token not found");
}
```

## Example

Here’s a complete example of how to set up and use the `JinaEmbeddings` class:

```typescript
import { JinaEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/jina";
import { localImageToBase64 } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/jina/util";

const embeddings = new JinaEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
 model: "jina-embeddings-v2-base-en",
});

async function runExample() {
 const queryEmbedding = await embeddings.embedQuery("Example query text.");
 console.log("Query Embedding:", queryEmbedding);

 const documents = [
 "hello",
 {
 text: "hello",
 },
 {
 image: "https://i.ibb.co/nQNGqL0/beach1.jpg",
 },
 {
 image: await localImageToBase64("beach1.jpg"),
 },
 ];
 const documentEmbeddings = await embeddings.embedDocuments(documents);
 console.log("Document Embeddings:", documentEmbeddings);
}

runExample();
```

# Llama CPP

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This module is based on the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) Node.js bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), allowing you to work with a locally running LLM. This allows you to work with a much smaller quantized model capable of running on a laptop environment, ideal for testing and scratch padding ideas without running up a bill!

## Setup

You'll need to install major version `3` of the [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) module to communicate with your local model.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S node-llama-cpp@3
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You will also need a local Llama 3 model (or a model supported by [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp)). You will need to pass the path to this model to the LlamaCpp module as a part of the parameters (see example).

Out-of-the-box `node-llama-cpp` is tuned for running on a MacOS platform with support for the Metal GPU of Apple M-series of processors. If you need to turn this off or need support for the CUDA architecture then refer to the documentation at [node-llama-cpp](https://withcatai.github.io/node-llama-cpp/).

For advice on getting and preparing `llama3` see the documentation for the LLM version of this module.

A note to LangChain.js contributors: if you want to run the tests associated with this module you will need to put the path to your local model in the environment variable `LLAMA_PATH`.

## Usage

### Basic use

We need to provide a path to our local Llama3 model, also the `embeddings` property is always set to `true` in this module.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import BasicExample from "@examples/embeddings/llama_cpp_basic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

### Document embedding

import DocsExample from "@examples/embeddings/llama_cpp_docs.ts";

# Minimax

The `MinimaxEmbeddings` class uses the Minimax API to generate embeddings for a given text.

# Setup

To use Minimax model, you'll need a [Minimax account](https://api.minimax.chat), an [API key](https://api.minimax.chat/user-center/basic-information/interface-key), and a [Group ID](https://api.minimax.chat/user-center/basic-information)

# Usage

```typescript
import { MinimaxEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/minimax";

export const run = async () => {
 /* Embed queries */
 const embeddings = new MinimaxEmbeddings();
 const res = await embeddings.embedQuery("Hello world");
 console.log(res);
 /* Embed documents */
 const documentRes = await embeddings.embedDocuments([
 "Hello world",
 "Bye bye",
 ]);
 console.log({ documentRes });
};
```

# Mixedbread AI

The `MixedbreadAIEmbeddings` class uses the [Mixedbread AI](https://mixedbread.ai/) API to generate text embeddings. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the `MixedbreadAIEmbeddings` class, helping you integrate it into your project effectively.

## Installation

To install the `@langchain/mixedbread-ai` package, use the following command:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/mixedbread-ai @langchain/core
```

## Initialization

First, sign up on the Mixedbread AI website and get your API key from [here](https://mixedbread.ai/). You can then use this key to initialize the `MixedbreadAIEmbeddings` class.

You can pass the API key directly to the constructor or set it as an environment variable (`MXBAI_API_KEY`).

### Basic Usage

Here’s how to create an instance of `MixedbreadAIEmbeddings`:

```typescript
import { MixedbreadAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/mixedbread-ai";

const embeddings = new MixedbreadAIEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
 // Optionally specify model
 // model: "mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1",
});
```

If the `apiKey` is not provided, it will be read from the `MXBAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Generating Embeddings

### Embedding a Single Query

To generate embeddings for a single text query, use the `embedQuery` method:

```typescript
const embedding = await embeddings.embedQuery(
 "Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: Is baking fun?"
);
console.log(embedding);
```

### Embedding Multiple Documents

To generate embeddings for multiple documents, use the `embedDocuments` method. This method handles batching automatically based on the `batchSize` parameter:

```typescript
const documents = ["Baking bread is fun", "I love baking"];

const embeddingsArray = await embeddings.embedDocuments(documents);
console.log(embeddingsArray);
```

## Customizing Requests

You can customize the SDK by passing additional parameters.

```typescript
const customEmbeddings = new MixedbreadAIEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
 baseUrl: "...",
 maxRetries: 6,
});
```

## Error Handling

If the API key is not provided and cannot be found in the environment variables, an error will be thrown:

```typescript
try {
 const embeddings = new MixedbreadAIEmbeddings();
} catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
}
```

# Nomic

The `NomicEmbeddings` class uses the Nomic AI API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

In order to use the Nomic API you'll need an API key.
You can sign up for a Nomic account and create an API key [here](https://atlas.nomic.ai/).

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/nomic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/nomic) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/nomic @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import NomicExample from "@examples/models/embeddings/nomic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{NomicExample}</CodeBlock>

# Prem AI

The `PremEmbeddings` class uses the Prem AI API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

In order to use the Prem API you'll need an API key. You can sign up for a Prem account and create an API key [here](https://app.premai.io/accounts/signup/).

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import PremExample from "@examples/embeddings/premai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{PremExample}</CodeBlock>

# TencentHunyuan

The `TencentHunyuanEmbeddings` class uses the Tencent Hunyuan API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

1. Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/register).
2. Create SecretID & SecretKey [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi).
3. Set SecretID and SecretKey as environment variables named `TENCENT_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENT_SECRET_KEY`, respectively.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

If you are using LangChain.js in a browser environment, you'll also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install crypto-js
```

And then make sure that you import from the `web` as shown below.

## Usage

Here's an example:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import TencentHunyuan from "@examples/models/embeddings/tencent_hunyuan.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TencentHunyuan}</CodeBlock>

# TensorFlow

This Embeddings integration runs the embeddings entirely in your browser or Node.js environment, using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). This means that your data isn't sent to any third party, and you don't need to sign up for any API keys. However, it does require more memory and processing power than the other integrations.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @tensorflow/tfjs-core@3.6.0 @tensorflow/tfjs-converter@3.6.0 @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder@1.3.3 @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu
```

```typescript
import "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu";
import { TensorFlowEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/tensorflow";

const embeddings = new TensorFlowEmbeddings();
```

This example uses the CPU backend, which works in any JS environment. However, you can use any of the backends supported by TensorFlow.js, including GPU and WebAssembly, which will be a lot faster. For Node.js you can use the `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` package, and for the browser you can use the `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl` package. See the [TensorFlow.js documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/platform_environment) for more information.

# HuggingFace Transformers

The `TransformerEmbeddings` class uses the [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) package to generate embeddings for a given text.

It runs locally and even works directly in the browser, allowing you to create web apps with built-in embeddings.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [@huggingface/transformers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/transformers) package as a peer dependency:

:::tip Compatibility
If you are using a version of community older than 0.3.21, install the older `@xenova/transformers` package and
import the embeddings from `"@langchain/community/embeddings/hf_transformers"` below.
:::

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @huggingface/transformers
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Example

Note that if you're using in a browser context, you'll likely want to put all inference-related code in a web worker to avoid
blocking the main thread.

See [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/tutorials/next) and the other resources in the Transformers.js docs for an idea of how to
set up your project.

# Voyage AI

The `VoyageEmbeddings` class uses the Voyage AI REST API to generate embeddings for a given text.

The `inputType` parameter allows you to specify the type of input text for better embedding results. You can set it to `query`, `document`, or leave it undefined (which is equivalent to `None`).

- `query`: Use this for search or retrieval queries. Voyage AI will prepend a prompt to optimize the embeddings for query use cases.
- `document`: Use this for documents or content that you want to be retrievable. Voyage AI will prepend a prompt to optimize the embeddings for document use cases.
- `None` (default): The input text will be directly encoded without any additional prompt.

```typescript
import { VoyageEmbeddings } from "@langchain/community/embeddings/voyage";

const embeddings = new VoyageEmbeddings({
 apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.VOYAGEAI_API_KEY
 inputType: "document", // Optional: specify input type as 'query', 'document', or omit for None / Undefined / Null
});
```

# ZhipuAI

The `ZhipuAIEmbeddings` class uses the ZhipuAI API to generate embeddings for a given text.

## Setup

You'll need to sign up for an ZhipuAI API key and set it as an environment variable named `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`.

https://open.bigmodel.cn

Then, you'll need to install the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core jsonwebtoken
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ZhipuAIExample from "@examples/embeddings/zhipuai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ZhipuAIExample}</CodeBlock>

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agent.
Connery will take care of critical aspects such as runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.

Furthermore, Connery, supported by our community, provides a diverse collection of ready-to-use open-source plugins for added convenience.

Learn more about Connery:

- GitHub: https://github.com/connery-io/connery
- Documentation: https://docs.connery.io

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agent, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

## Example of using Connery Toolkit

### Setup

To use the Connery Toolkit you need to install the following official peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

### Usage

In the example below, we create an agent that uses two Connery Actions to summarize a public webpage and send the summary by email:

1. **Summarize public webpage** action from the [Summarization](https://github.com/connery-io/summarization-plugin) plugin.
2. **Send email** action from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.

:::info
You can see a LangSmith trace of this example [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/5485cb37-b73d-458f-8162-43639f2b49e1/r).

:::note
Connery Action is a structured tool, so you can only use it in the agents supporting structured tools.

# JSON Agent Toolkit

This example shows how to load and use an agent with a JSON toolkit.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as yaml from "js-yaml";
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { JsonSpec, JsonObject } from "langchain/tools";
import { JsonToolkit, createJsonAgent } from "langchain/agents";

export const run = async () => {
 let data: JsonObject;
 try {
 const yamlFile = fs.readFileSync("openai_openapi.yaml", "utf8");
 data = yaml.load(yamlFile) as JsonObject;
 if (!data) {
 throw new Error("Failed to load OpenAPI spec");
 }
 } catch (e) {
 console.error(e);
 return;
 }

 const toolkit = new JsonToolkit(new JsonSpec(data));
 const model = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 });
 const executor = createJsonAgent(model, toolkit);

 const input = `What are the required parameters in the request body to the /completions endpoint?`;

 console.log(`Executing with input "${input}"...`);

 const result = await executor.invoke({ input });

 console.log(`Got output ${result.output}`);

 console.log(
 `Got intermediate steps ${JSON.stringify(
 result.intermediateSteps,
 null,

 )}`
 );
};

# AWS Step Functions Toolkit

**AWS Step Functions** are a visual workflow service that helps developers use AWS services to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning (ML) pipelines.

By including a `AWSSfn` tool in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to invoke async workflows running in your AWS Cloud.

When an Agent uses the `AWSSfn` tool, it will provide an argument of type `string` which will in turn be passed into one of the supported actions this tool supports. The supported actions are: `StartExecution`, `DescribeExecution`, and `SendTaskSuccess`.

## Setup

You'll need to install the Node AWS Step Functions SDK:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sfn
```

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

### Note about credentials:

- If you have not run [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) via the AWS CLI, the `region`, `accessKeyId`, and `secretAccessKey` must be provided to the AWSSfn constructor.
- The IAM role corresponding to those credentials must have permission to invoke the Step Function.

# ChatGPT Plugins

:::warning
OpenAI has [deprecated plugins](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plugins/).
:::

This example shows how to use ChatGPT Plugins within LangChain abstractions.

Note 1: This currently only works for plugins with no auth.

Note 2: There are almost certainly other ways to do this, this is just a first pass. If you have better ideas, please open a PR!

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

````
Entering new agent_executor chain...
Thought: Klarna is a payment provider, not a store. I need to check if there is a Klarna Shopping API that I can use to search for t-shirts.
Action:
```

{
"action": "KlarnaProducts",
"action_input": ""
}

```

Usage Guide: Use the Klarna plugin to get relevant product suggestions for any shopping or researching purpose. The query to be sent should not include stopwords like articles, prepositions and determinants. The api works best when searching for words that are related to products, like their name, brand, model or category. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user.

OpenAPI Spec: {"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"version":"v0","title":"Open AI Klarna product Api"},"servers":[{"url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping"}],"tags":[{"name":"open-ai-product-endpoint","description":"Open AI Product Endpoint. Query for products."}],"paths":{"/public/openai/v0/products":{"get":{"tags":["open-ai-product-endpoint"],"summary":"API for fetching Klarna product information","operationId":"productsUsingGET","parameters":[{"name":"q","in":"query","description":"query, must be between 2 and 100 characters","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"size","in":"query","description":"number of products returned","required":false,"schema":{"type":"integer"}},{"name":"budget","in":"query","description":"maximum price of the matching product in local currency, filters results","required":false,"schema":{"type":"integer"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Products found","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ProductResponse"}}}},"503":{"description":"one or more services are unavailable"}},"deprecated":false}}},"components":{"schemas":{"Product":{"type":"object","properties":{"attributes":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"name":{"type":"string"},"price":{"type":"string"},"url":{"type":"string"}},"title":"Product"},"ProductResponse":{"type":"object","properties":{"products":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/Product"}}},"title":"ProductResponse"}}}}
Now that I know there is a Klarna Shopping API, I can use it to search for t-shirts. I will make a GET request to the API with the query parameter "t-shirt".
Action:
```

{
"action": "requests_get",
"action_input": "https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/public/openai/v0/products?q=t-shirt"
}

```

{"products":[{"name":"Psycho Bunny Mens Copa Gradient Logo Graphic Tee","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3203663222/Clothing/Psycho-Bunny-Mens-Copa-Gradient-Logo-Graphic-Tee/?source=openai","price":"$35.00","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:White,Blue,Black,Orange"]},{"name":"T-shirt","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3203506327/Clothing/T-shirt/?source=openai","price":"$20.45","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:Gray,White,Blue,Black,Orange"]},{"name":"Palm Angels Bear T-shirt - Black","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3201090513/Clothing/Palm-Angels-Bear-T-shirt-Black/?source=openai","price":"$168.36","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:Black"]},{"name":"Tommy Hilfiger Essential Flag Logo T-shirt","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3201840629/Clothing/Tommy-Hilfiger-Essential-Flag-Logo-T-shirt/?source=openai","price":"$22.52","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:Red,Gray,White,Blue,Black","Pattern:Solid Color","Environmental Attributes :Organic"]},{"name":"Coach Outlet Signature T Shirt","url":"https://www.klarna.com/us/shopping/pl/cl10001/3203005573/Clothing/Coach-Outlet-Signature-T-Shirt/?source=openai","price":"$75.00","attributes":["Material:Cotton","Target Group:Man","Color:Gray"]}]}
Finished chain.

# Azure Container Apps Dynamic Sessions

> [Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/sessions) provide fast access to secure sandboxed environments that are ideal for running code or applications that require strong isolation from other workloads.

You can learn more about Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions and its code interpretation capabilities on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/sessions). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-dynamic-sessions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-dynamic-sessions) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/azure-dynamic-sessions @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to have a code interpreter session pool instance running. You can deploy a version using [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/sessions-code-interpreter).

Once you have your instance running, you need to make sure you have properly set up the Azure Entra authentication for it. You can find the instructions on how to do that [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/sessions?tabs=azure-cli#authentication).

After you've added the role for your identity, you need to retrieve the **session pool management endpoint**. You can find it in the Azure Portal, under the "Overview" section of your instance. Then you need to set the following environment variable:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import EnvVars from "@examples/tools/azure_dynamic_sessions/.env.example";

<CodeBlock language="text">{EnvVars}</CodeBlock>

## Usage example

Below is a simple example that creates a new Python code interpreter session, invoke the tool and prints the result.

import Example from "@examples/tools/azure_dynamic_sessions/azure_dynamic_sessions.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Here is a complete example where we use an Azure OpenAI chat model to call the Python code interpreter session tool to execute the code and get the result:

import AgentExample from "@examples/tools/azure_dynamic_sessions/azure_dynamic_sessions-agent.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AgentExample}</CodeBlock>

# Connery Action Tool

Using this tool, you can integrate individual Connery Action into your LangChain agent.

:::note
If you want to use more than one Connery Action in your agent,
check out the [Connery Toolkit](/docs/integrations/toolkits/connery) documentation.
:::

## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agent.
Connery will take care of critical aspects such as runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.

Furthermore, Connery, supported by our community, provides a diverse collection of ready-to-use open-source plugins for added convenience.

Learn more about Connery:

- GitHub: https://github.com/connery-io/connery
- Documentation: https://docs.connery.io

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agent, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

## Example of using Connery Action Tool

### Setup

To use the Connery Action Tool you need to install the following official peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

### Usage

In the example below, we fetch action by its ID from the Connery Runner and then call it with the specified parameters.

Here, we use the ID of the **Send email** action from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.

:::info
You can see a LangSmith trace of this example [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/c4b6723d-f91c-440c-8682-16ec8297a602/r).
:::

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Connery Action is a structured tool, so you can only use it in the agents supporting structured tools.

# Dall-E Tool

The Dall-E tool allows your agent to create images using OpenAI's Dall-E image generation tool.

## Setup

You will need an OpenAI API Key which you can get from the [OpenAI web site](https://openai.com)
and then set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to the key you just created.

To use the Dall-E Tool you need to install the LangChain OpenAI integration package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core

While the moisture is very high, the continuous exotic sea breezes keep the circumstances very relaxed throughout the season. During the day you will be relaxed in a T-shirt or an Aloha clothing and a couple of shoes. Once the sun places you will probably want to wear a light coat since the circumstances can fall around ten levels. The protecting impact of the hills and the variations in climate at various levels make a variety of environment areas. The unique micro-climates are specific for the internal valleys, hill hills and seashores in The hawaiian islands. Located at the side of the exotic location and due to year-round heated sea exterior circumstances, which keep the overlying environment heated, The hawaiian islands has only two circumstances, both of them heated and one with a little bit more rain. Hawaii Climate During Summer Between the several weeks of Apr and Nov the environment is more dry and hotter with the conditions including 75-88. In the summer time the northern eastern business gusts of wind carry most of the rain to the destinations leeward part, which delivers a welcome comfort from the hot and dry climate.The conditions you will encounter will be proportional to where you are on the destinations. If you are on the edges that are protected from the gusts of wind, the the southeast part of and European factors, you will encounters hot and dry circumstances. If you are on the windward factors, northern or eastern, you will obtain the complete power of the gusts of wind and encounter moister and shade circumstances. Go windward for exotic circumstances and leeward for an dry environment. Hawaii Climate During Winter From Dec to Apr it is just a little bit chilly, with conditions between 68-80 F. Winter season is regarded rain. The biggest down pours come between Oct and Apr (the hoo'ilo season). Though stormy weather may be common, they usually complete through the destinations quickly and without event. There are more dark times to mess up your laying in the sun, but it hardly ever down pours more than 3 times in a row in one identify. Winter is search period, so if you're a search participant, come to the Northern Coast in Explore to get the ideal trend. Also, whale viewing period is at the end of winter, during Jan to Apr, so make sure you are here if you want to see these spectacular creatures! Hawaii Climate is Greatly Influenced by the Mountains The hills around the destinations are accountable for the large variety of circumstances. As an example, Kauai's Mt. Waialele is one of the rainiest destinations on the world. Mt. Waialele gets over 420 inches large of rainfall each season, but just a few kilometers down the line, Waimea Canyn is absolutely dry and has been nicknamed the \\\"Grand Canyn of the Pacific\\\". On Big Isle The hawaiian destinations, Hilo is one of the rainiest places in the nation, with 180 inches large of rainfall a season. But Puako, only 60 kilometers away, gets less than 6 inches large of rainfall. If you choose to discover the organic charm discovered at greater levels such as Mauna Kea, use long jeans and several levels of awesome climate outfits. The heat variety in the greater destinations falls 3.5 levels for every 1,000 toes above sea level.Watching the dawn from Mt Haleakala's peak is a incredible concept, but be sure to package up with neckties and work gloves that will keep you comfortable. The circumstances at the peak can fall to 30 F!. Also know that there is less security from the sun at greater levels so be sure to utilize the sun display liberally and use eyewear and a hat. The environment can modify greatly in just a few time when you are in the hills. The exclusive The hawaiian destinations environment makes it possible to sun shower on the Kona Shore and ski on Mauna Kea in the same day.\"}],\"requestId\":\"2145d8de65373c70250400c2c9e8eb13\"}\n"

Photo: WiseTim . \\\\nMount Wai‘ale‘ale on the gorgeous island of Kaua‘i is often referred to as the wettest spot on earth. While the more than 5,000-foot tall mountain that’s often enshrouded in clouds does receive a tremendous amount of rainfall each year, it’s more accurately “one of” the wettest spots on earth. The average annual rainfall is around 500 inches but some spots on the planet, such as “Big Bog” on Maui, typically acquire even more moisture.\\\\nLegend Has It\\\\n Road to Waialeale Basin, Kauai. Photo: Bryce Edwards . \\\\nMany legends surround this mystical peak that includes native inhabitants climbing to the top to make offerings to the Hawaiian god, Kane. Remains of a heiau (place of worship constructed from rocks) at the summit confirm that some kind of ancient activity took place here, even though getting to the water-logged location seems nearly impossible.\\\\nWai‘ale‘ale, which is actually a dormant shield volcano, means “rippling or overflowing water” in Hawaiian. Consider yourself lucky if you capture a glimpse of the top of the sky-high summit during your vacation. The best opportunity is during crisp, early mornings before clouds form. But you also need to be in the proper location – Līhu‘e, Kapa‘a, and Wailua offer some of the best vantage points for Wai‘ale‘ale.\\\\nAs Seen From Kuilau Ridge\\\\n Views of Mount Waialeale from Kuilau Ridge, Kauai. Photo: Martin Bravenboer . \\\\nTo get even closer to the second-highest peak on the island you can traverse the Kuilau Ridge Trail in Wailua, located near the end of Kuamo‘o Road. About midway through the easy 2-mile roundtrip hike is a great spot for viewing the mountain.\\\\nWeeping Wall\\\\n Mount Waialeale “Wall of Tears” from the air. Photo: FH . \\\\nFurther down the road and well beyond the paved portion is another hike that takes daring souls to the basin of Wai‘ale‘ale called the “Weeping Wall” where numerous ribbons of waterfalls cascade from the summit. But don’t even consider this adventure unless you’re accompanied by an experienced local guide, as you can easily get lost since there is no maintained trail and there is always a high risk for flash flooding that creates dangerous encounters with rushing water.\\\\nViews from the Alakai Swamp Trail\\\\n Kilohana Overlook of Hanalei Bay. Photo: Hawaii Savvy . \\\\nThat said, there is another safer way to get close to this magical mountain – via the Alaka‘i Swamp Trail located in Koke‘e State Park. The difficult hike is about 8 miles roundtrip and you must start out extremely early to get to the midway point in time to see the vista before fog settles in. But those who see Wai‘ale‘ale uncovered at this prime vantage point, along with Hanalei Bay below, are in for a tremendous treat.\\\"}],\\\"requestId\\\":\\\"37fb09f547148c664026aa61f19c27ed\\\"}\",\n",

 "No one seems to think brushing kitty's teeth is worth the hassle. Tyler Comrie / The Atlantic; Getty On the list of perfect pet parents, Mikel Delgado, a professional feline-behavior consultant, probably ranks high. The Ph.D. expert in animal cognition spends half an hour each evening playing with her three torbie cats, Ruby, Coriander, and Professor Scribbles. She’s trained them to take pills in gelatin capsules, just in case they eventually need meds. She even commissioned a screened-in backyard catio so that the girls can safely venture outside. Delgado would do anything for her cats—well, almost anything. “Guilty as charged,” Delgado told me. “I do not brush my cats’ teeth.” To be fair, most cat owners don’t—probably because they’re well aware that it’s weird, if not downright terrifying, to stick one’s fingers inside an ornery cat’s mouth. Reliable stats are scarce, but informal surveys suggest that less than 5 percent of owners give their cats the dental scrub-a-dub-dub—an estimate that the vets I spoke with endorse. “I’m always very shocked if someone says they brush their cat’s teeth,” says Anson Tsugawa, a veterinary dentist in California. When Steve Valeika, a vet in North Carolina, suggests the practice to his clients, many of them “look at me like I’ve totally lost it,” he told me. (This is where I out myself as one of the loons: My cats, Calvin and Hobbes, get their teeth brushed thrice weekly.) There certainly is an element of absurdity to all of this. Lions, after all, aren’t skulking the savannas for Oral-Bs. But our pets don’t share the diets and lifestyles of their wild counterparts, and their teeth are quite susceptible to the buildup of bacteria that can eventually invade the gums to trigger prolonged, painful disease. Studies suggest that most domestic cats older than four end up developing some sort of gum affliction; several experts told me that the rates of periodontal disease in household felines can exceed 80 percent. Left untreated, these ailments can cost a cat one or more teeth, or even spread their effects throughout the body, potentially compromising organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart. To stave off kitty gum disease, veterinary guidelines and professionals generally recommend that owners clean their cat’s chompers daily, ideally for at least a minute, hitting every tooth. “That’s the gold standard,” says Santiago Peralta, a veterinary dentist at Cornell University. Even a gap of two or three days can leave enough time for tartar to cement, Jeanne Perrone, a veterinary-dentistry trainer in Florida, told me. But brushing feline teeth is also really, really, really hard. Most cats aren’t keen on having things shoved into their mouth, especially not bristly, sludge-covered sticks. (Dogs don’t always love cleanings either, but they’re at least used to engaging their owners with their mouths.) My old cat, Luna, was once so desperate to escape a brushing that she shrieked in my face, then peed all over the floor. Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths A niche industry has sprouted to ease the ordeal for hygiene-conscious humans: poultry-flavored toothpastes, cat-size toothbrushes, silicone scrubbers that fit on fingers. Sometimes the gear helps; when Chin-Sun Lee, a New Orleans–based writer, purchased malt-flavored toothpaste for her cat, Tuesday, he went bonkers for the stuff. Every morning, he comes trotting over just so he can lick the brush. Krissy Lyon, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute, told me that one of her cats, Cocchi, is so crazy for his toothpaste that she and her partner have to “restrain him or lock him in a different room” while they’re brushing the teeth of their other cat, Noma. Tuesday (left) and Calvin (right) getting their teeth brushed. (Courtesy of Chin-Sun Lee and Katherine J. Wu) But tasty toothpaste isn’t a sufficient lure for all. Valeika, who extols the virtues of feline oral health, admitted that even his own cat, Boocat, doesn’t reap the benefits of his brushing expertise. He “tried hard-core for a couple weeks” when he adopted her seven years ago. But Boocat was too feisty to stand for such a thing. “She can be a real terror,” Valeika told me. “We once saw her chase a bear out of our yard.” Maybe Boocat is picking up on how odd the whole toothbrushing ritual can be. Even most American people weren’t regularly scrubbing their dentition until around the time of World War II. Vet dentistry, which borrowed principles from its human analogue, “is a relatively new discipline,” Peralta told me. “Thirty years ago, nobody was even thinking about dog or cat teeth.” Nor was it all that long ago that people across the country routinely let their pets sleep outside, eat only table scraps, and run hog wild through the streets. Now pets have become overly pampered, their accessories Gooped. Experts told me that they’ve seen all kinds of snake-oil hacks that purport to functionally replace feline toothbrushing—sprays, gels, toys, water additives, even calls to rub cat teeth with coconut oil. A lot of these products end up just cosmetically whitening teeth, temporarily freshening breath, or accomplishing nothing at all. If a super-simple, once-a-month magic bullet for dental hygiene existed, Tsugawa told me, “we’d be doing it for our own teeth.” There are probably a lot of un-toothbrushed cats out there who could be s-l-o-w-l-y taught to accept the process and maybe even enjoy it. Mary Berg, the president of Beyond the Crown Veterinary Education, told me that one of her colleagues trained her pet to relish the process so much that “she could just say ‘Brusha brusha brusha’ and the cat would come running.” But getting to that point can require weeks or months of conditioning. Berg recommends taking it day by day, introducing cats first to the toothpaste, then to getting one or two teeth touched, and on and on until they’re comfy with the whole set—always “with lots of praise and reward afterward,” she said. And that’s all before “you introduce that scary plastic thing.” Read: An offbeat approach to bonding with cats That’s a big ask for many owners, especially those who went the cat route because of the creatures’ rep for being low-maintenance. The consequences of skipping toothbrushing are also subtle because they don’t directly affect humans, Delgado told me. Miss a nail trimming, and the couch might pay the price. But cat teeth aren’t often glimpsed. Boocat, defender of the realm (Courtesy of Steve Valeika) The potential downsides of brushing, meanwhile, can be screamingly clear. On cat forums and Twitter, the cat-toothbrushing-phobic joke about losing their fingers. But what a lot of people are really afraid of sacrificing is their cat’s love. Broken trust can mar the relationship between owner and pet, Perrone said; people simply can’t communicate to skittish animals that this act of apparent torture is for their own good. Some cats never learn to deal. Even among veterinary experts, toothbrushing rituals are rare. Peralta and his wife just try to clear the bar of “at least once a week” with their own cat, Kit Kat; Berg and Perrone don’t brush their felines’ teeth at all. (Tsugawa does not currently own a cat, but he wasn’t a brusher when he did.) I’m no pro, but I feel a bit torn too. I never took the time to teach Calvin and Hobbes to see toothbrushing as a treat, and they can get pretty grumpy during the ritual itself. Valeika, the North Carolina vet, told me that seeing Boocat’s horrified reactions was the main thing that prompted him to quit the brush. “She would hate it if we were always doing that to her,” he said. “She really would just not be our pet anymore.” Feline-health experts know they’re losing this fight. “A lot of us are not even talking about toothbrushing anymore, because nobody’s doing it,” Berg said. Luckily, a few well-vetted alternatives to toothbrushing do exist. Berg and Delgado use specialty kibble that can cut down on plaque, and Perrone’s cat, Noriko, is into Greenies dental treats—both options that many pets may be more receptive to. Scientifically, nothing beats bona fide brushing. But realistically, this young art may already be obsolete. The best interventions, Delgado told me, will be the ones that people actually use. “If someone in my profession doesn’t brush their pet’s teeth,” Berg said, “I can’t blame anybody else.”\n",

 "Last night I watched the Netflix documentary, Inside the Mind of a Cat . It was a good show that demonstrated cats are thoughtful creatures and amazing predators and that they may have intellectual capacities on par with dogs.\n",
 "In addition to learning about the research, I watched the show from my perspective as a mental behaviorist. A mental behavioral position is one that bridges and resolves the old divide in psychology between the behaviorists (who say that the mind is not a scientific construct and thus they just study behavior) and the mentalists (who say they study overt behaviors and then infer mental processes that are presumed to cause the behaviors).\n",
 "The mental behavioral view says that animals like cats are “minded” creatures, and that they exhibit mental behaviors. To see this, imagine three cats in a tree; one is dead, one is anesthetized, and one is alive and well. Now drop the cats. The mental behaviorist says all three cats behave, but they exhibit different kinds of behaviors as they fall. The first cat falls through the air and lands on the ground. Its behavior is “physical” in that it is caused by the laws and forces of the material world as mapped by the physical sciences. The second cat also falls much like the first. However, if we were to peer inside the cat, we would see that its physiology is very active in maintaining its complex organization. The behaviors of the cat’s cells and organ systems that keep it alive are living behaviors studied by the biological sciences.\n",
 "The third cat rotates, lands on its feet, and takes off. This is a different kind of behavior that cannot be well-described as either physical or biological. Rather, the proper description is mental. Mental behavior is a particular kind of functional awareness and responsivity that animals exhibit. Such behaviors are actions mediated by the brain and nervous system and the complex active body of the cat. More specifically, mental behaviors are a pattern of activity that emerges as function of a complex adaptive, sensory-motor looping system. \n",
 "Just as we consider entities like cells that exhibit living behaviors to be alive, we should consider creatures like cats that exhibit mental behaviors to be “minded.” The mental behaviorist argues that mindedness is one of the most important concepts that both science and most modern people are blind to. I say “modern people” because, historically, most cultures have seen clearly that animals behave very differently when compared to plants or bacteria, and most cultures have had some kind of category for specifying this difference. For example, Aristotle divided the \"soul\" into the vegetative, animal, and human layers. In addition, the Great Chain of Being differentiated animals from the rest of the living world. However, our modern scientific system does not have a word for the way animals are in the world that makes them so different. We just call it \"animal behavior.\" And this gap is a major blind spot in our grammar for understanding the world around us.\n",
 "Returning to the documentary, if we did not really look inside \"the mind\" of cats, what did the documentary actually show? It showed the mental behavioral investment patterns of cats. That is, it showed how cats demonstrate functional awareness and responsivity to various kinds of situations and stimuli. For example, it showed they clearly recognize and respond to their names, it showed they prefer their owners to strangers, and it showed they really do have a unique skill set in their capacity to land on their feet. In other words, it showed cats are minded creatures that exhibit complex adaptive patterns of mental behavior.\n",
 "Although it becomes obvious when you know how to see the world this way (i.e., when I go for a walk in the woods, the mindedness of the squirrels, birds, and bees is as blatantly apparent to me as the living behaviors of the trees and mushrooms), it nevertheless takes practice to learn how to see mindedness in the world. However, we need to make the effort because failing to see mindedness in the world results in much blindness.\n",
 "I found a fascinating article from The Atlantic that delves into the often-overlooked aspect of feline care: brushing cats' teeth. Despite being a crucial part of maintaining a cat's health, very few cat owners actually brush their pets' teeth. The article highlights the challenges and absurdities of this task, noting that less than 5% of cat owners engage in this practice. \n",
 "\n",
 "Veterinary experts emphasize the importance of dental hygiene for cats, as most domestic cats over the age of four develop some form of gum disease, which can lead to severe health issues if left untreated. The article discusses various tools and techniques, such as poultry-flavored toothpaste and cat-sized toothbrushes, that can make the process easier. However, it also acknowledges the difficulties and resistance many cats show towards toothbrushing.\n",
 "\n",
 "Interestingly, the article also touches on the broader context of pet care, noting how the expectations and practices around pet maintenance have evolved over time. It suggests that while brushing a cat's teeth is ideal, alternative methods like dental treats and specialized kibble can also be effective.\n",

# Google Trends Tool

The Google Trends Tool allows your agent to utilize the Google Trends API from SerpApi to retrieve and analyze search interest data.
This can be useful for understanding trending topics, regional search interest, and historical popularity of search terms.

For API details see [here](https://serpapi.com/google-trends-api)

SerpApi caches queries, so the first query will be slower while subsequent identical queries will be fast.
Occasionally, related queries will not work while interest over time will be fine. You can check your query [here](https://serpapi.com/playground?engine=google_trends&q=monster&data_type=RELATED_QUERIES).

## Setup

To use this tool, you will need to configure access to the Google Trends API from SerpApi.

Get an API key from [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_in)

Then, set your API key as `process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY` or pass it in as an `apiKey` constructor argument.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/google_trends.ts";

# Tools and Toolkits

import { CategoryTable, IndexTable } from "@theme/FeatureTables";

[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools) are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A [toolkit](/docs/concepts/tools/#toolkits) is a collection of tools meant to be used together. For a list of toolkit integrations, see [this page](/docs/integrations/toolkits/).

:::info
If you'd like to write your own tool, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/custom_tools/). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).

# Agent with AWS Lambda Integration

Full docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/index.html

**AWS Lambda** is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to allow developers to build and run applications and services without the need for provisioning or managing servers. This serverless architecture enables you to focus on writing and deploying code, while AWS automatically takes care of scaling, patching, and managing the infrastructure required to run your applications.

By including a AWSLambda in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to invoke code running in your AWS Cloud for whatever purposes you need.

When an Agent uses the AWSLambda tool, it will provide an argument of type `string` which will in turn be passed into the Lambda function via the `event` parameter.

This quick start will demonstrate how an Agent could use a Lambda function to send an email via [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). The lambda code which sends the email is not provided, but if you'd like to learn how this could be done, see [here](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/lambda-send-email-ses). Keep in mind this is an intentionally simple example; Lambda can used to execute code for a near infinite number of other purposes (including executing more Langchains)!

### Note about credentials:

- If you have not run [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) via the AWS CLI, the `region`, `accessKeyId`, and `secretAccessKey` must be provided to the AWSLambda constructor.
- The IAM role corresponding to those credentials must have permission to invoke the lambda function.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { SerpAPI } from "langchain/tools";
import { AWSLambda } from "langchain/tools/aws_lambda";
import { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "langchain/agents";

const model = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 });
const emailSenderTool = new AWSLambda({
 name: "email-sender",
 // tell the Agent precisely what the tool does
 description:
 "Sends an email with the specified content to testing123@gmail.com",
 region: "us-east-1", // optional: AWS region in which the function is deployed
 accessKeyId: "abc123", // optional: access key id for a IAM user with invoke permissions
 secretAccessKey: "xyz456", // optional: secret access key for that IAM user
 functionName: "SendEmailViaSES", // the function name as seen in AWS Console
});
const tools = [emailSenderTool, new SerpAPI("api_key_goes_here")];
const executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, model, {
 agentType: "zero-shot-react-description",
});

const input = `Find out the capital of Croatia. Once you have it, email the answer to testing123@gmail.com.`;
const result = await executor.invoke({ input });
console.log(result);
```

# Stagehand Toolkit

The Stagehand Toolkit equips your AI agent with the following capabilities:

- **navigate()**: Navigate to a specific URL.
- **act()**: Perform browser automation actions like clicking, typing, and navigation.
- **extract()**: Extract structured data from web pages using Zod schemas.
- **observe()**: Get a list of possible actions and elements on the current page.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

2. Create a Stagehand Instance
 If you plan to run the browser locally, you'll also need to install Playwright's browser dependencies.

```bash
npx playwright install
```

3. Set up your model provider credentials:

For OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

For Anthropic:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

## Usage, Standalone, Local Browser

```typescript
import { StagehandToolkit } from "langchain/community/agents/toolkits/stagehand";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Stagehand } from "@browserbasehq/stagehand";

// Specify your Browserbase credentials.
process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY = "";
process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID = "";

// Specify OpenAI API key.
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "";

const stagehand = new Stagehand({
 env: "LOCAL",
 headless: false,
 verbose: 2,
 debugDom: true,
 enableCaching: false,
});

// Create a Stagehand Toolkit with all the available actions from the Stagehand.
const stagehandToolkit = await StagehandToolkit.fromStagehand(stagehand);

const navigateTool = stagehandToolkit.tools.find(
 (t) => t.name === "stagehand_navigate"
);
if (!navigateTool) {
 throw new Error("Navigate tool not found");
}
await navigateTool.invoke("https://www.google.com");

const actionTool = stagehandToolkit.tools.find(
 (t) => t.name === "stagehand_act"
);
if (!actionTool) {
 throw new Error("Action tool not found");
}
await actionTool.invoke('Search for "OpenAI"');

const observeTool = stagehandToolkit.tools.find(
 (t) => t.name === "stagehand_observe"
);
if (!observeTool) {
 throw new Error("Observe tool not found");
}
const result = await observeTool.invoke(
 "What actions can be performed on the current page?"
);
const observations = JSON.parse(result);

// Handle observations as needed
console.log(observations);

const currentUrl = stagehand.page.url();
expect(currentUrl).toContain("google.com/search?q=OpenAI");
```

## Usage with LangGraph Agents

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Usage on Browserbase - remote headless browser

If you want to run the browser remotely, you can use the Browserbase platform.

You need to set the `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` environment variable to your Browserbase API key.

```bash
export BROWSERBASE_API_KEY="your-browserbase-api-key"
```

You also need to set `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` to your Browserbase project ID.

```bash
export BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-browserbase-project-id"
```

Then initialize the Stagehand instance with the `BROWSERBASE` environment.

```typescript
const stagehand = new Stagehand({
 env: "BROWSERBASE",
});
```

# Web Browser Tool

The Webbrowser Tool gives your agent the ability to visit a website and extract information. It is described to the agent as

```
useful for when you need to find something on or summarize a webpage. input should be a comma separated list of "valid URL including protocol","what you want to find on the page or empty string for a summary".
```

It exposes two modes of operation:

- when called by the Agent with only a URL it produces a summary of the website contents
- when called by the Agent with a URL and a description of what to find it will instead use an in-memory Vector Store to find the most relevant snippets and summarise those

## Setup

To use the Webbrowser Tool you need to install the dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cheerio axios
```

## Usage, standalone

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/webbrowser.ts";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ToolExample}</CodeBlock>

## Usage, in an Agent

import AgentExample from "@examples/agents/mrkl_browser.ts";

# Agent with Zapier NLA Integration

:::warning
This module has been deprecated and is no longer supported. The documentation below will not work in versions 0.2.0 or later.
:::

Full docs here: https://nla.zapier.com/start/

**Zapier Natural Language Actions** gives you access to the 5k+ apps and 20k+ actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface.

NLA supports apps like Gmail, Salesforce, Trello, Slack, Asana, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more apps: https://zapier.com/apps

Zapier NLA handles ALL the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output for LLMs. The key idea is you, or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API.

NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.

Server-side (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where LangChain will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)

User-facing (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and LangChain needs access to end-user's exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com

Attach NLA credentials via either an environment variable (`ZAPIER_NLA_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `ZAPIER_NLA_API_KEY`) or refer to the params argument in the API reference for `ZapierNLAWrapper`.

Review [auth docs](https://nla.zapier.com/docs/authentication/) for more details.

The example below demonstrates how to use the Zapier integration as an Agent:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ZapierNLAWrapper } from "langchain/tools";
import {
 initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions,
 ZapierToolKit,
} from "langchain/agents";

const model = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 });
const zapier = new ZapierNLAWrapper();

# Azure AI Search

[Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-search) (formerly known as Azure Search and Azure Cognitive Search) is a distributed, RESTful search engine optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads on Azure. It supports also vector search using the [k-nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) (kNN) algorithm and also [semantic search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview).

This vector store integration supports full text search, vector search and [hybrid search for best ranking performance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-cognitive-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167).

Learn how to leverage the vector search capabilities of Azure AI Search from [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-overview). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the `@azure/search-documents` SDK and the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/community @langchain/core @azure/search-documents
```

You'll also need to have an Azure AI Search instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost, following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the endpoint and the admin key (query keys can be used only to search document, not to index, update or delete). The endpoint is the URL of your instance which you can find in the Azure Portal, under the "Overview" section of your instance. The admin key can be found under the "Keys" section of your instance. Then you need to set the following environment variables:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import EnvVars from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/azure_aisearch/.env.example";

<CodeBlock language="text">{EnvVars}</CodeBlock>

## About hybrid search

Hybrid search is a feature that combines the strengths of full text search and vector search to provide the best ranking performance. It's enabled by default in Azure AI Search vector stores, but you can select a different search query type by setting the `search.type` property when creating the vector store.

You can read more about hybrid search and how it may improve your search results in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview).

In some scenarios like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), you may want to enable **semantic ranking** in addition to hybrid search to improve the relevance of the search results. You can enable semantic ranking by setting the `search.type` property to `AzureAISearchQueryType.SemanticHybrid` when creating the vector store.
Note that semantic ranking capabilities are only available in the Basic and higher pricing tiers, and subject to [regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=search).

You can read more about the performance of using semantic ranking with hybrid search in [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-cognitive-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167).

## Example: index docs, vector search and LLM integration

Below is an example that indexes documents from a file in Azure AI Search, runs a hybrid search query, and finally uses a chain to answer a question in natural language based on the retrieved documents.

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/azure_aisearch/azure_aisearch.ts";

# Cassandra

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

[Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) is a NoSQL, row-oriented, highly scalable and highly available database.

The [latest version](<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-30%3A+Approximate+Nearest+Neighbor(ANN)+Vector+Search+via+Storage-Attached+Indexes>) of Apache Cassandra natively supports Vector Similarity Search.

## Setup

First, install the Cassandra Node.js driver:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cassandra-driver @langchain/community @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

Depending on your database providers, the specifics of how to connect to the database will vary. We will create a document `configConnection` which will be used as part of the vector store configuration.

### Apache Cassandra®

Vector search is supported in [Apache Cassandra® 5.0](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/Apache-Cassandra-5.0-Moving-Toward-an-AI-Driven-Future.html) and above. You can use a standard connection document, for example:

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 contactPoints: ['h1', 'h2'],
 localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',
 credentials: {
 username: <...> as string,
 password: <...> as string,
 },
};
```

### Astra DB

Astra DB is a cloud-native Cassandra-as-a-Service platform.

1. Create an [Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/register).
2. Create a [vector enabled database](https://astra.datastax.com/createDatabase).
3. Create a [token](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) for your database.

```typescript
const configConnection = {
 serviceProviderArgs: {
 astra: {
 token: <...> as string,
 endpoint: <...> as string,
 },
 },
};
```

Instead of `endpoint:`, you many provide property `datacenterID:` and optionally `regionName:`.

## Indexing docs

```typescript
import { CassandraStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/cassandra";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

// The configConnection document is defined above
const config = {
 ...configConnection,
 keyspace: "test",
 dimensions: 1536,
 table: "test",
 indices: [{ name: "name", value: "(name)" }],
 primaryKey: {
 name: "id",
 type: "int",
 },
 metadataColumns: [
 {
 name: "name",
 type: "text",
 },
 ],
};

const vectorStore = await CassandraStore.fromTexts(
 ["I am blue", "Green yellow purple", "Hello there hello"],
 [
 { id: 2, name: "2" },
 { id: 1, name: "1" },
 { id: 3, name: "3" },
 ],
 new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
 cassandraConfig
);
```

## Querying docs

```typescript
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("Green yellow purple", 1);
```

or filtered query:

```typescript
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("B", 1, { name: "Bubba" });
```

## Vector Types

Cassandra supports `cosine` (the default), `dot_product`, and `euclidean` similarity search; this is defined when the
vector store is first created, and specifed in the constructor parameter `vectorType`, for example:

```typescript
 ...,
 vectorType: "dot_product",
 ...
```

## Indices

With Version 5, Cassandra introduced Storage Attached Indexes, or SAIs. These allow `WHERE` filtering without specifying
the partition key, and allow for additional operator types such as non-equalities. You can define these with the `indices`
parameter, which accepts zero or more dictionaries each containing `name` and `value` entries.

Indices are optional, though required if using filtered queries on non-partition columns.

- The `name` entry is part of the object name; on a table named `test_table` an index with `name: "some_column"`
 would be `idx_test_table_some_column`.
- The `value` entry is the column on which the index is created, surrounded by `(` and `)`. With the above column
 `some_column` it would be specified as `value: "(some_column)"`.
- An optional `options` entry is a map passed to the `WITH OPTIONS =` clause of the `CREATE CUSTOM INDEX` statement.
 The specific entries on this map are index type specific.

```typescript
 indices: [{ name: "some_column", value: "(some_column)" }],
```

## Advanced Filtering

By default, filters are applied with an equality `=`. For those fields that have an `indices` entry, you may
provide an `operator` with a string of a value supported by the index; in this case, you specify one or
more filters, as either a singleton or in a list (which will be `AND`-ed together). For example:

```typescript
 { name: "create_datetime", operator: ">", value: some_datetime_variable }
```

or

```typescript
[
 { userid: userid_variable },
 { name: "create_datetime", operator: ">", value: some_date_variable },
];
```

`value` can be a single value or an array. If it is not an array, or there is only one element in `value`,
the resulting query will be along the lines of `${name} ${operator} ?` with `value` bound to the `?`.

If there is more than one element in the `value` array, the number of unquoted `?` in `name` are counted
and subtracted from the length of `value`, and this number of `?` is put on the right side of the operator;
if there are more than one `?` then they will be encapsulated in `(` and `)`, e.g. `(?, ?, ?)`.

This faciliates bind values on the left of the operator, which is useful for some functions; for example
a geo-distance filter:

```typescript
{
 name: "GEO_DISTANCE(coord, ?)",
 operator: "<",
 value: [new Float32Array([53.3730617,-6.3000515]), 10000],
},
```

## Data Partitioning and Composite Keys

In some systems, you may wish to partition the data for various reasons, perhaps by user or by session. Data in Cassandra
is always partitioned; by default this library will partition by the first primary key field. You may specify multiple
columns which comprise the primary (unique) key of a record, and optionally indicate those fields which should be
part of the partition key. For example, the vector store could be partitioned by both `userid` and `collectionid`, with
additional fields `docid` and `docpart` making an individual entry unique:

```typescript
 ...,
 primaryKey: [
 {name: "userid", type: "text", partition: true},
 {name: "collectionid", type: "text", partition: true},
 {name: "docid", type: "text"},
 {name: "docpart", type: "int"},
 ],
 ...
```

When searching, you may include partition keys on the filter without defining `indices` for these columns; you do
not need to specify all partition keys, but must specify those in the key first. In the above example, you could
specify a filter of `{userid: userid_variable}` and `{userid: userid_variable, collectionid: collectionid_variable}`,
but if you wanted to specify a filter of only `{collectionid: collectionid_variable}` you would have to include
`collectionid` on the `indices` list.

## Additional Configuration Options

In the configuration document, further optional parameters are provided; their defaults are:

```typescript
 ...,
 maxConcurrency: 25,
 batchSize: 1,
 withClause: "",
 ...
```

| Parameter | Usage |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxConcurrency` | How many concurrent requests will be sent to Cassandra at a given time. |
| `batchSize` | How many documents will be sent on a single request to Cassandra. When using a value > 1, you should ensure your batch size will not exceed the Cassandra parameter `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb`. Batches are unlogged. |
| `withClause` | Cassandra tables may be created with an optional `WITH` clause; this is generally not needed but provided for completeness. |

# Cloudflare Vectorize

If you're deploying your project in a Cloudflare worker, you can use [Cloudflare Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/) with LangChain.js.
It's a powerful and convenient option that's built directly into Cloudflare.

## Setup

:::tip Compatibility
Cloudflare Vectorize is currently in open beta, and requires a Cloudflare account on a paid plan to use.
:::

After [setting up your project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/get-started/intro/#prerequisites),
create an index by running the following Wrangler command:

```bash
$ npx wrangler vectorize create <index_name> --preset @cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5
```

You can see a full list of options for the `vectorize` command [in the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#vectorize).

You'll then need to update your `wrangler.toml` file to include an entry for `[[vectorize]]`:

```toml
[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "<index_name>"
```

Finally, you'll need to install the LangChain Cloudflare integration package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/cloudflare @langchain/core
```

## Usage

Below is an example worker that adds documents to a vectorstore, queries it, or clears it depending on the path used. It also uses [Cloudflare Workers AI Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/cloudflare_ai).

:::note
If running locally, be sure to run wrangler as `npx wrangler dev --remote`!
:::

```toml
name = "langchain-test"
main = "worker.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-10"

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "langchain-test"

[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/cloudflare_vectorize/example.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

You can also pass a `filter` parameter to filter by previously loaded metadata.
See [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/learning/metadata-filtering/)
for information on the required format.

# Couchbase

[Couchbase](http://couchbase.com/) is an award-winning distributed NoSQL cloud database that delivers unmatched versatility, performance, scalability, and financial value for all of your cloud, mobile,
AI, and edge computing applications. Couchbase embraces AI with coding assistance for developers and vector search for their applications.

Vector Search is a part of the [Full Text Search Service](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/search-service.html) (Search Service) in Couchbase.

This tutorial explains how to use Vector Search in Couchbase. You can work with both [Couchbase Capella](https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella/) and your self-managed Couchbase Server.

## Installation

You will need couchbase and langchain community to use couchbase vector store. For this tutorial, we will use OpenAI embeddings

```bash npm2yarn
npm install couchbase @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

## Create Couchbase Connection Object

We create a connection to the Couchbase cluster initially and then pass the cluster object to the Vector Store. Here, we are connecting using the username and password.
You can also connect using any other supported way to your cluster.

For more information on connecting to the Couchbase cluster, please check the [Node SDK documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/current/hello-world/start-using-sdk.html#connect).

```typescript
import { Cluster } from "couchbase";

const connectionString = "couchbase://localhost"; // or couchbases://localhost if you are using TLS
const dbUsername = "Administrator"; // valid database user with read access to the bucket being queried
const dbPassword = "Password"; // password for the database user

const couchbaseClient = await Cluster.connect(connectionString, {
 username: dbUsername,
 password: dbPassword,
 configProfile: "wanDevelopment",
});
```

## Create the Search Index

Currently, the Search index needs to be created from the Couchbase Capella or Server UI or using the REST interface.

For this example, let us use the Import Index feature on the Search Service on the UI.

Let us define a Search index with the name `vector-index` on the testing bucket.
We are defining an index on the `testing` bucket's `_default` scope on the `_default` collection with the vector field set to `embedding` with 1536 dimensions and the text field set to `text`.
We are also indexing and storing all the fields under `metadata` in the document as a dynamic mapping to account for varying document structures. The similarity metric is set to `dot_product`.

### How to Import an Index to the Full Text Search service?

- [Couchbase Server](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/search/import-search-index.html)
 - Click on Search -> Add Index -> Import
 - Copy the following Index definition in the Import screen
 - Click on Create Index to create the index.
- [Couchbase Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/import-search-index.html)
 - Copy the following index definition to a new file `index.json`
 - Import the file in Capella using the instructions in the documentation.
 - Click on Create Index to create the index.

### Index Definition

 }
}
```

For more details on how to create a search index with support for Vector fields, please refer to the documentation:

- [Couchbase Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/create-search-indexes.html)
- [Couchbase Server](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/search/create-search-indexes.html)

For using this vector store, CouchbaseVectorStoreArgs needs to be configured.
textKey and embeddingKey are optional fields, required if you want to use specific keys

```typescript
const couchbaseConfig: CouchbaseVectorStoreArgs = {
 cluster: couchbaseClient,
 bucketName: "testing",
 scopeName: "_default",
 collectionName: "_default",
 indexName: "vector-index",
 textKey: "text",
 embeddingKey: "embedding",
};
```

## Create Vector Store

We create the vector store object with the cluster information and the search index name.

```typescript
const store = await CouchbaseVectorStore.initialize(
 embeddings, // embeddings object to create embeddings from text
 couchbaseConfig
);
```

## Basic Vector Search Example

The following example showcases how to use couchbase vector search and perform similarity search.
For this example, we are going to load the "state_of_the_union.txt" file via the TextLoader,
chunk the text into 500 character chunks with no overlaps and index all these chunks into Couchbase.

After the data is indexed, we perform a simple query to find the top 4 chunks that are similar to the
query "What did president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson".
At the end, it also shows how to get similarity score

```ts
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import {
 CouchbaseVectorStoreArgs,
 CouchbaseVectorStore,
} from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/couchbase";
import { Cluster } from "couchbase";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

const connectionString =
 process.env.COUCHBASE_DB_CONN_STR ?? "couchbase://localhost";
const databaseUsername = process.env.COUCHBASE_DB_USERNAME ?? "Administrator";
const databasePassword = process.env.COUCHBASE_DB_PASSWORD ?? "Password";

// Load documents from file
const loader = new TextLoader("./state_of_the_union.txt");
const rawDocuments = await loader.load();
const splitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
 chunkSize: 500,
 chunkOverlap: 0,
});
const docs = await splitter.splitDocuments(rawDocuments);

const couchbaseClient = await Cluster.connect(connectionString, {
 username: databaseUsername,
 password: databasePassword,
 configProfile: "wanDevelopment",
});

// Open AI API Key is required to use OpenAIEmbeddings, some other embeddings may also be used
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
 apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const couchbaseConfig: CouchbaseVectorStoreArgs = {
 cluster: couchbaseClient,
 bucketName: "testing",
 scopeName: "_default",
 collectionName: "_default",
 indexName: "vector-index",
 textKey: "text",
 embeddingKey: "embedding",
};

const store = await CouchbaseVectorStore.fromDocuments(
 docs,
 embeddings,
 couchbaseConfig
);

const query = "What did president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson";

const resultsSimilaritySearch = await store.similaritySearch(query);
console.log("resulting documents: ", resultsSimilaritySearch[0]);

// Similarity Search With Score
const resultsSimilaritySearchWithScore = await store.similaritySearchWithScore(
 query,
 1
);
console.log("resulting documents: ", resultsSimilaritySearchWithScore[0][0]);
console.log("resulting scores: ", resultsSimilaritySearchWithScore[0][1]);

const result = await store.similaritySearch(query, 1, {
 fields: ["metadata.source"],
});
console.log(result[0]);
```

## Specifying Fields to Return

You can specify the fields to return from the document using `fields` parameter in the filter during searches.
These fields are returned as part of the `metadata` object. You can fetch any field that is stored in the index.
The `textKey` of the document is returned as part of the document's `pageContent`.

If you do not specify any fields to be fetched, all the fields stored in the index are returned.

If you want to fetch one of the fields in the metadata, you need to specify it using `.`
For example, to fetch the `source` field in the metadata, you need to use `metadata.source`.

```typescript
const result = await store.similaritySearch(query, 1, {
 fields: ["metadata.source"],
});
console.log(result[0]);
```

## Hybrid Search

Couchbase allows you to do hybrid searches by combining vector search results with searches on non-vector fields of the document like the `metadata` object.

The results will be based on the combination of the results from both vector search and the searches supported by full text search service.
The scores of each of the component searches are added up to get the total score of the result.

To perform hybrid searches, there is an optional key, `searchOptions` in `fields` parameter that can be passed to all the similarity searches. 
The different search/query possibilities for the `searchOptions` can be found [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/search/search-request-params.html#query-object).

### Create Diverse Metadata for Hybrid Search

In order to simulate hybrid search, let us create some random metadata from the existing documents.
We uniformly add three fields to the metadata, `date` between 2010 & 2020, `rating` between 1 & 5 and `author` set to either John Doe or Jane Doe.
We will also declare few sample queries.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < docs.length; i += 1) {
 docs[i].metadata.date = `${2010 + (i % 10)}-01-01`;
 docs[i].metadata.rating = 1 + (i % 5);
 docs[i].metadata.author = ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"][i % 2];
}

const store = await CouchbaseVectorStore.fromDocuments(
 docs,
 embeddings,
 couchbaseConfig
);

const query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson";
const independenceQuery = "Any mention about independence?";
```

### Example: Search by Exact Value

We can search for exact matches on a textual field like the author in the `metadata` object.

```typescript
const exactValueResult = await store.similaritySearch(query, 4, {
 fields: ["metadata.author"],
 searchOptions: {
 query: { field: "metadata.author", match: "John Doe" },
 },
});
console.log(exactValueResult[0]);
```

### Example: Search by Partial Match

We can search for partial matches by specifying a fuzziness for the search. This is useful when you want to search for slight variations or misspellings of a search query.

Here, "Johny" is close (fuzziness of 1) to "John Doe".

```typescript
const partialMatchResult = await store.similaritySearch(query, 4, {
 fields: ["metadata.author"],
 searchOptions: {
 query: { field: "metadata.author", match: "Johny", fuzziness: 1 },
 },
});
console.log(partialMatchResult[0]);
```

### Example: Search by Date Range Query

We can search for documents that are within a date range query on a date field like `metadata.date`.

```typescript
const dateRangeResult = await store.similaritySearch(independenceQuery, 4, {
 fields: ["metadata.date", "metadata.author"],
 searchOptions: {
 query: {
 start: "2016-12-31",
 end: "2017-01-02",
 inclusiveStart: true,
 inclusiveEnd: false,
 field: "metadata.date",
 },
 },
});
console.log(dateRangeResult[0]);
```

### Example: Search by Numeric Range Query

We can search for documents that are within a range for a numeric field like `metadata.rating`.

```typescript
const ratingRangeResult = await store.similaritySearch(independenceQuery, 4, {
 fields: ["metadata.rating"],
 searchOptions: {
 query: {
 min: 3,
 max: 5,
 inclusiveMin: false,
 inclusiveMax: true,
 field: "metadata.rating",
 },
 },
});
console.log(ratingRangeResult[0]);
```

### Example: Combining Multiple Search Conditions

Different queries can by combined using AND (conjuncts) or OR (disjuncts) operators.

In this example, we are checking for documents with a rating between 3 & 4 and dated between 2015 & 2018.

```typescript
const multipleConditionsResult = await store.similaritySearch(texts[0], 4, {
 fields: ["metadata.rating", "metadata.date"],
 searchOptions: {
 query: {
 conjuncts: [
 { min: 3, max: 4, inclusive_max: true, field: "metadata.rating" },
 { start: "2016-12-31", end: "2017-01-02", field: "metadata.date" },
 ],
 },
 },
});
console.log(multipleConditionsResult[0]);
```

### Other Queries

Similarly, you can use any of the supported Query methods like Geo Distance, Polygon Search, Wildcard, Regular Expressions, etc in the `searchOptions` Key of `filter` parameter.
Please refer to the documentation for more details on the available query methods and their syntax.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Question: Should I create the Search index before creating the CouchbaseVectorStore object?

Yes, currently you need to create the Search index before creating the `CouchbaseVectorStore` object.

## Question: I am not seeing all the fields that I specified in my search results.

In Couchbase, we can only return the fields stored in the Search index. Please ensure that the field that you are trying to access in the search results is part of the Search index.

One way to handle this is to index and store a document's fields dynamically in the index.

- In Capella, you need to go to "Advanced Mode" then under the chevron "General Settings" you can check "[X] Store Dynamic Fields" or "[X] Index Dynamic Fields"
- In Couchbase Server, in the Index Editor (not Quick Editor) under the chevron "Advanced" you can check "[X] Store Dynamic Fields" or "[X] Index Dynamic Fields"

Note that these options will increase the size of the index.

For more details on dynamic mappings, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/customize-index.html).

## Question: I am unable to see the metadata object in my search results.

This is most likely due to the `metadata` field in the document not being indexed and/or stored by the Couchbase Search index. In order to index the `metadata` field in the document, you need to add it to the index as a child mapping.

If you select to map all the fields in the mapping, you will be able to search by all metadata fields. Alternatively, to optimize the index, you can select the specific fields inside `metadata` object to be indexed.
You can refer to the [docs](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/customize-index.html) to learn more about indexing child mappings.

To create Child Mappings, you can refer to the following docs -

- [Couchbase Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/create-child-mapping.html)
- [Couchbase Server](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/fts/fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.html)

# Google Vertex AI Matching Engine

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

The Google Vertex AI Matching Engine "provides the industry's leading high-scale
low latency vector database. These vector databases are commonly referred
to as vector similarity-matching or an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) service."

## Setup

:::caution
This module expects an endpoint and deployed index already created as the
creation time takes close to one hour. To learn more, see the LangChain python
documentation [Create Index and deploy it to an Endpoint](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/matchingengine#create-index-and-deploy-it-to-an-endpoint).
:::

Before running this code, you should make sure the Vertex AI API is
enabled for the relevant project in your Google Cloud dashboard and that you've authenticated to
Google Cloud using one of these methods:

- You are logged into an account (using `gcloud auth application-default login`)
 permitted to that project.
- You are running on a machine using a service account that is permitted
 to the project.
- You have downloaded the credentials for a service account that is permitted
 to the project and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
 variable to the path of this file.

Install the authentication library with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core google-auth-library
```

The Matching Engine does not store the actual document contents, only embeddings. Therefore, you'll
need a docstore. The below example uses Google Cloud Storage, which requires the following:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @google-cloud/storage
```

## Usage

### Initializing the engine

When creating the `MatchingEngine` object, you'll need some information about
the matching engine configuration. You can get this information from the Cloud Console
for Matching Engine:

- The id for the Index
- The id for the Index Endpoint

You will also need a document store. While an `InMemoryDocstore` is ok for
initial testing, you will want to use something like a
[GoogleCloudStorageDocstore](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_community.stores_doc_gcs.GoogleCloudStorageDocstore.html) to store it more permanently.

```typescript
import { MatchingEngine } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/googlevertexai";
import { Document } from "langchain/document";
import { SyntheticEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/fake";
import { GoogleCloudStorageDocstore } from "@langchain/community/stores/doc/gcs";

const embeddings = new SyntheticEmbeddings({
 vectorSize: Number.parseInt(
 process.env.SYNTHETIC_EMBEDDINGS_VECTOR_SIZE ?? "768",
 10
 ),
});

const store = new GoogleCloudStorageDocstore({
 bucket: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET!,
});

const config = {
 index: process.env.GOOGLE_VERTEXAI_MATCHINGENGINE_INDEX!,
 indexEndpoint: process.env.GOOGLE_VERTEXAI_MATCHINGENGINE_INDEXENDPOINT!,
 apiVersion: "v1beta1",
 docstore: store,
};

const engine = new MatchingEngine(embeddings, config);
```

### Adding documents

```typescript
const doc = new Document({ pageContent: "this" });
await engine.addDocuments([doc]);
```

Any metadata in a document is converted into Matching Engine "allow list" values
that can be used to filter during a query.

```typescript
const documents = [
 new Document({
 pageContent: "this apple",
 metadata: {
 color: "red",
 category: "edible",
 },
 }),
 new Document({
 pageContent: "this blueberry",
 metadata: {
 color: "blue",
 category: "edible",
 },
 }),
 new Document({
 pageContent: "this firetruck",
 metadata: {
 color: "red",
 category: "machine",
 },
 }),
];

// Add all our documents
await engine.addDocuments(documents);
```

The documents are assumed to have an "id" parameter available as well. If this
is not set, then an ID will be assigned and returned as part of the Document.

### Querying documents

Doing a straightforward k-nearest-neighbor search which returns all results
is done using any of the standard methods:

```typescript
const results = await engine.similaritySearch("this");
```

### Querying documents with a filter / restriction

We can limit what documents are returned based on the metadata that was
set for the document. So if we just wanted to limit the results to those
with a red color, we can do:

```typescript
import { Restriction } from `langchain/vectorstores/googlevertexai`;

const redFilter: Restriction[] = [
 {
 namespace: "color",
 allowList: ["red"],
 },
];
const redResults = await engine.similaritySearch("this", 4, redFilter);
```

If we wanted to do something more complicated, like things that are red,
but not edible:

```typescript
const filter: Restriction[] = [
 {
 namespace: "color",
 allowList: ["red"],
 },
 {
 namespace: "category",
 denyList: ["edible"],
 },
];
const results = await engine.similaritySearch("this", 4, filter);
```

### Deleting documents

Deleting documents are done using ID.

```typescript
import { IdDocument } from `langchain/vectorstores/googlevertexai`;

const oldResults: IdDocument[] = await engine.similaritySearch("this", 10);
const oldIds = oldResults.map( doc => doc.id! );
await engine.delete({ids: oldIds});
```

# SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine

[SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide/ai.html#article8) is a vector store fully integrated into the `SAP HANA Cloud database`.

## Setup

You'll first need to install either the [`@sap/hana-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/hana-client) or the [`hdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hdb) package, and the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/community @langchain/core @sap/hana-client
# or
npm install -S @langchain/community @langchain/core hdb
```

You'll also need to have database connection to a HANA Cloud instance.

## Basic Vectorstore Operations

import ExampleBasic from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/hana_vector/basics.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleBasic}</CodeBlock>

## Advanced filtering

import { Table, Tr, Th, Td } from "@mdx-js/react";

In addition to the basic value-based filtering capabilities, it is possible to use more advanced filtering. The table below shows the available filter operators.

| Operator | Semantic |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$eq` | Equality (==) |
| `$ne` | Inequality (!=) |
| `$lt` | Less than (<) |
| `$lte` | Less than or equal (<=) |
| `$gt` | Greater than (>) |
| `$gte` | Greater than or equal (>=) |
| `$in` | Contained in a set of given values (in) |
| `$nin` | Not contained in a set of given values (not in) |
| `$between` | Between the range of two boundary values |
| `$like` | Text equality based on the "LIKE" semantics in SQL (using "%" as wildcard) |
| `$and` | Logical "and", supporting 2 or more operands |
| `$or` | Logical "or", supporting 2 or more operands |

# libSQL

[Turso](https://turso.tech) is a SQLite-compatible database built on [libSQL](https://docs.turso.tech/libsql), the Open Contribution fork of SQLite. Vector Similiarity Search is built into Turso and libSQL as a native datatype, enabling you to store and query vectors directly in the database.

LangChain.js supports using a local libSQL, or remote Turso database as a vector store, and provides a simple API to interact with it.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with libSQL vector stores. For detailed documentation of all libSQL features and configurations head to the API reference.

## Overview

## Integration details

| Class | Package | PY support | Package latest |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LibSQLVectorStore` | `@langchain/community` | ❌ | ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/community) |

## Setup

To use libSQL vector stores, you'll need to create a Turso account or set up a local SQLite database, and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.

This guide will also use OpenAI embeddings, which require you to install the `@langchain/openai` integration package. You can also use other supported embeddings models if you wish.

You can use local SQLite when working with the libSQL vector store, or use a hosted Turso Database.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @libsql/client @langchain/openai @langchain/community
```

Now it's time to create a database. You can create one locally, or use a hosted Turso database.

### Local libSQL

Create a new local SQLite file and connect to the shell:

```bash
sqlite3 file.db
```

### Hosted Turso

Visit [sqlite.new](https://sqlite.new) to create a new database, give it a name, and create a database auth token.

Make sure to copy the database auth token, and the database URL, it should look something like:

```text
libsql://[database-name]-[your-username].turso.io
```

### Setup the table and index

Execute the following SQL command to create a new table or add the embedding column to an existing table.

Make sure to modify the following parts of the SQL:

- `TABLE_NAME` is the name of the table you want to create.
- `content` is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values.
- `metadata` is used to store the `Document.metadata` object.
- `EMBEDDING_COLUMN` is used to store the vector values, use the dimensions size used by the model you plan to use (1536 for OpenAI).

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TABLE_NAME (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
 content TEXT,
 metadata TEXT,
 EMBEDDING_COLUMN F32_BLOB(1536) -- 1536-dimensional f32 vector for OpenAI
);
```

Now create an index on the `EMBEDDING_COLUMN` column - the index name is important!:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_TABLE_NAME_EMBEDDING_COLUMN ON TABLE_NAME(libsql_vector_idx(EMBEDDING_COLUMN));
```

Make sure to replace the `TABLE_NAME` and `EMBEDDING_COLUMN` with the values you used in the previous step.

## Instantiation

To initialize a new `LibSQL` vector store, you need to provide the database URL and Auth Token when working remotely, or by passing the filename for a local SQLite.

```typescript
import { LibSQLVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/libsql";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
 model: "text-embedding-3-small",
});

const libsqlClient = createClient({
 url: "libsql://[database-name]-[your-username].turso.io",
 authToken: "...",
});

// Local instantiation
// const libsqlClient = createClient({
// url: "file:./dev.db",
// });

const vectorStore = new LibSQLVectorStore(embeddings, {
 db: libsqlClient,
 table: "TABLE_NAME",
 column: "EMBEDDING_COLUMN",
});
```

## Manage vector store

### Add items to vector store

```typescript
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const documents: Document[] = [
 { pageContent: "Hello", metadata: { topic: "greeting" } },
 { pageContent: "Bye bye", metadata: { topic: "greeting" } },
];

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents);
```

### Delete items from vector store

```typescript
await vectorStore.deleteDocuments({ ids: [1, 2] });
```

## Query vector store

Once you have inserted the documents, you can query the vector store.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```typescript
const resultOne = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("hola", 1);

for (const doc of similaritySearchResults) {
 console.log(`${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}
```

For similarity search with scores:

```typescript
const similaritySearchWithScoreResults =
 await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore("hola", 1);

for (const [doc, score] of similaritySearchWithScoreResults) {
 console.log(
 `${score.toFixed(3)} ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata)}]`
 );
}
```

# Momento Vector Index (MVI)

[MVI](https://gomomento.com): the most productive, easiest to use, serverless vector index for your data. To get started with MVI, simply sign up for an account. There's no need to handle infrastructure, manage servers, or be concerned about scaling. MVI is a service that scales automatically to meet your needs. Whether in Node.js, browser, or edge, Momento has you covered.

To sign up and access MVI, visit the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).

## Setup

1. Sign up for an API key in the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
2. Install the SDK for your environment.

 2.1. For **Node.js**:

 ```bash npm2yarn
 npm install @gomomento/sdk
 ```

 2.2. For **browser or edge environments**:

 ```bash npm2yarn
 npm install @gomomento/sdk-web
 ```

3. Setup Env variables for Momento before running the code

 3.1 OpenAI

 ```bash
 export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
 ```

 3.2 Momento

 ```bash
 export MOMENTO_API_KEY=YOUR_MOMENTO_API_KEY_HERE # https://console.gomomento.com
 ```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

### Index documents using `fromTexts` and search

This example demonstrates using the `fromTexts` method to instantiate the vector store and index documents.
If the index does not exist, then it will be created. If the index already exists, then the documents will be
added to the existing index.

The `ids` are optional; if you omit them, then Momento will generate UUIDs for you.

import TextsExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/momento_vector_index/fromTexts.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TextsExample}</CodeBlock>

### Index documents using `fromDocuments` and search

Similar to the above, this example demonstrates using the `fromDocuments` method to instantiate the vector store and index documents.
If the index does not exist, then it will be created. If the index already exists, then the documents will be
added to the existing index.

Using `fromDocuments` allows you to seamlessly chain the various document loaders with indexing.

import DocsExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/momento_vector_index/fromDocs.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DocsExample}</CodeBlock>

### Search from an existing collection

import ExistingExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/momento_vector_index/fromExisting.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExistingExample}</CodeBlock>

 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "To use MongoDB Atlas vector stores, you'll need to configure a MongoDB Atlas cluster and install the `@langchain/mongodb` integration package.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Initial Cluster Configuration\n",
 "\n",
 "To create a MongoDB Atlas cluster, navigate to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) and create an account if you don't already have one.\n",
 "\n",
 "Create and name a cluster when prompted, then find it under `Database`. Select `Browse Collections` and create either a blank collection or one from the provided sample data.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Note:** The cluster created must be MongoDB 7.0 or higher.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Creating an Index\n",
 "\n",
 "After configuring your cluster, you'll need to create an index on the collection field you want to search over.\n",
 "\n",
 "Switch to the `Atlas Search` tab and click `Create Search Index`. From there, make sure you select `Atlas Vector Search - JSON Editor`, then select the appropriate database and collection and paste the following into the textbox:\n",
 "\n",
 "```json\n",
 "{\n",
 " \"fields\": [\n",
 " {\n",
 " \"numDimensions\": 1536,\n",
 " \"path\": \"embedding\",\n",
 " \"similarity\": \"euclidean\",\n",
 " \"type\": \"vector\"\n",
 " }\n",
 " ]\n",
 "}\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "Note that the dimensions property should match the dimensionality of the embeddings you are using. For example, Cohere embeddings have 1024 dimensions, and by default OpenAI embeddings have 1536:\n",
 "\n",
 "Note: By default the vector store expects an index name of default, an indexed collection field name of embedding, and a raw text field name of text. You should initialize the vector store with field names matching your index name collection schema as shown below.\n",
 "\n",
 "Finally, proceed to build the index.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Embeddings\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide will also use [OpenAI embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai), which require you to install the `@langchain/openai` integration package. You can also use [other supported embeddings models](/docs/integrations/text_embedding) if you wish.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "Install the following packages:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import IntegrationInstallTooltip from \"@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx\";\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from \"@theme/Npm2Yarn\";\n",
 "\n",
 "<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " @langchain/mongodb mongodb @langchain/openai @langchain/core\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "### Credentials\n",
 "\n",
 "Once you've done the above, set the `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI` environment variable from the `Connect` button in Mongo's dashboard. You'll also need your DB name and collection name:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "process.env.MONGODB_ATLAS_URI = \"your-atlas-url\";\n",
 "process.env.MONGODB_ATLAS_COLLECTION_NAME = \"your-atlas-db-name\";\n",
 "process.env.MONGODB_ATLAS_DB_NAME = \"your-atlas-db-name\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you are using OpenAI embeddings for this guide, you'll need to set your OpenAI key as well:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\";\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
 "\n",
 "```typescript\n",
 "// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",

 " \"fields\": [\n",
 " {\n",
 " \"numDimensions\": 1024,\n",

 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "Above, the first item in `fields` is the vector index, and the second item is the metadata property you want to filter on. The name of the property is the value of the `path` key. So the above index would allow us to search on a metadata field named `source`.\n",
 "\n",
 "Then, in your code you can use [MQL Query Operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) for filtering.\n",

# Neo4j Vector Index

Neo4j is an open-source graph database with integrated support for vector similarity search.
It supports:

- approximate nearest neighbor search
- Euclidean similarity and cosine similarity
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword searches

## Setup

To work with Neo4j Vector Index, you need to install the `neo4j-driver` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install neo4j-driver
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

### Setup a `Neo4j` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`Neo4j` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Neo4j database instance.
Create a file below named `docker-compose.yml`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DockerExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/docker-compose.example.yml";

<CodeBlock language="yml" name="docker-compose.yml">
 {DockerExample}
</CodeBlock>

And then in the same directory, run `docker compose up` to start the container.

You can find more information on how to setup `Neo4j` on their [website](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/).

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector.ts";

One complete example of using `Neo4jVectorStore` is the following:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

### Use retrievalQuery parameter to customize responses

import RetrievalExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_retrieval.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalExample}</CodeBlock>

### Instantiate Neo4jVectorStore from existing graph

import ExistingGraphExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_existinggraph.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExistingGraphExample}</CodeBlock>

### Metadata filtering

import MetadataExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neo4j_vector/neo4j_vector_metadata.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MetadataExample}</CodeBlock>

# Disclaimer ⚠️

_Security note_: Make sure that the database connection uses credentials
that are narrowly-scoped to only include necessary permissions.
Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling
code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation
of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such
data is present in the database.
The best way to guard against such negative outcomes is to (as appropriate)
limit the permissions granted to the credentials used with this tool.
For example, creating read only users for the database is a good way to
ensure that the calling code cannot mutate or delete data.
See the [security page](/docs/security) for more information.

# Neon Postgres

Neon is a fully managed serverless PostgreSQL database. It separates storage and compute to offer
features such as instant branching and automatic scaling.

With the `pgvector` extension, Neon provides a vector store that can be used with LangChain.js to store and query embeddings.

## Setup

### Select a Neon project

If you do not have a Neon account, sign up for one at [Neon](https://neon.tech). After logging into the Neon Console, proceed
to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section and select an existing project or create a new one.

Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb` that you can use to store embeddings. Navigate to
the Connection Details section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

### Application code

To work with Neon Postgres, you need to install the `@neondatabase/serverless` package which provides a JavaScript/TypeScript
driver to connect to the database.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

To initialize a `NeonPostgres` vectorstore, you need to provide your Neon database connection string. You can use the connection string
we fetched above directly, or store it as an environment variable and use it in your code.

```typescript
const vectorStore = await NeonPostgres.initialize(embeddings, {
 connectionString: NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,
});
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/neon/example.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# OpenSearch

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a fork of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) that is fully compatible with the Elasticsearch API. Read more about their support for Approximate Nearest Neighbors [here](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/approximate-knn/).

Langchain.js accepts [@opensearch-project/opensearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/javascript/index/) as the client for OpenSearch vectorstore.

## Setup

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/openai @langchain/core @opensearch-project/opensearch
```

You'll also need to have an OpenSearch instance running. You can use the [official Docker image](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/docker/) to get started. You can also find an example docker-compose file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/examples/src/indexes/vector_stores/opensearch/docker-compose.yml).

## Index docs

```typescript
import { Client } from "@opensearch-project/opensearch";
import { Document } from "langchain/document";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { OpenSearchVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/opensearch";

const client = new Client({
 nodes: [process.env.OPENSEARCH_URL ?? "http://127.0.0.1:9200"],
});

const docs = [
 new Document({
 metadata: { foo: "bar" },
 pageContent: "opensearch is also a vector db",
 }),
 new Document({
 metadata: { foo: "bar" },
 pageContent: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog",
 }),
 new Document({
 metadata: { baz: "qux" },
 pageContent: "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
 }),
 new Document({
 metadata: { baz: "qux" },
 pageContent:
 "OpenSearch is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications",
 }),
];

await OpenSearchVectorStore.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {
 client,
 indexName: process.env.OPENSEARCH_INDEX, // Will default to `documents`
});
```

## Query docs

```typescript
import { Client } from "@opensearch-project/opensearch";
import { VectorDBQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { OpenSearchVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/opensearch";

const client = new Client({
 nodes: [process.env.OPENSEARCH_URL ?? "http://127.0.0.1:9200"],
});

const vectorStore = new OpenSearchVectorStore(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {
 client,
});

/* Search the vector DB independently with meta filters */
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("hello world", 1);
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
/* [
 {
 "pageContent": "Hello world",
 "metadata": {
 "id": 2

 }
 ] */

/* Use as part of a chain (currently no metadata filters) */
const model = new OpenAI();
const chain = VectorDBQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStore, {
 k: 1,
 returnSourceDocuments: true,
});
const response = await chain.call({ query: "What is opensearch?" });

console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
/*

 "## Create HNSW Index\n",
 "\n",
 "By default, the extension performs a sequential scan search, with 100% recall. You might consider creating an HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to speed up `similaritySearchVectorWithScore` execution time. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use the `createHnswIndex()` method.\n",
 "\n",
 "The method parameters include:\n",
 "\n",
 "- `dimensions`: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data type, up to 2000. For example, use 1536 for OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 and Amazon's amazon.titan-embed-text-v1 models.\n",
 "\n",
 "- `m?`: The max number of connections per layer (16 by default). Index build time improves with smaller values, while higher values can speed up search queries.\n",
 "\n",
 "- `efConstruction?`: The size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default). A higher value can potentially improve the index quality at the cost of index build time.\n",
 "\n",
 "- `distanceFunction?`: The distance function name you want to use, is automatically selected based on the distanceStrategy.\n",
 "\n",
 "For more info, see the [Pgvector GitHub repo](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#hnsw) and the [HNSW paper from Malkov Yu A. and Yashunin D. A.. 2020.

# Prisma

For augmenting existing models in PostgreSQL database with vector search, Langchain supports using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) together with PostgreSQL and [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

## Setup

### Setup database instance with Supabase

Refer to the [Prisma and Supabase integration guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma) to setup a new database instance with Supabase and Prisma.

### Install Prisma

```bash npm2yarn
npm install prisma
```

### Setup `pgvector` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`pgvector` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Postgres instance.

```yaml
services:
 db:
 image: ankane/pgvector
 ports:
 - 5432:5432
 volumes:
 - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
 environment:
 - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
 - POSTGRES_USER=
 - POSTGRES_DB=

volumes:
 db:
```

### Create a new schema

Assuming you haven't created a schema yet, create a new model with a `vector` field of type `Unsupported("vector")`:

```prisma
model Document {
 id String @id @default(cuid())
 content String
 vector Unsupported("vector")?
}
```

Afterwards, create a new migration with `--create-only` to avoid running the migration directly.

```bash npm2yarn
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

Add the following line to the newly created migration to enable `pgvector` extension if it hasn't been enabled yet:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Run the migration afterwards:

```bash npm2yarn
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

:::warning
Table names and column names (in fields such as `tableName`, `vectorColumnName`, `columns` and `filter`) are passed into SQL queries directly without parametrisation.
These fields must be sanitized beforehand to avoid SQL injection.
:::

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/prisma_vectorstore/prisma.ts";
import Schema from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/prisma_vectorstore/prisma/schema.prisma";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

The following SQL operators are available as filters: `equals`, `in`, `isNull`, `isNotNull`, `like`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte`, `not`.

The samples above uses the following schema:

<CodeBlock language="prisma">{Schema}</CodeBlock>

You can remove `namespace` if you don't need it.

# SingleStore

[SingleStoreDB](https://singlestore.com/) is a robust, high-performance distributed SQL database solution designed to excel in both [cloud](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud/) and on-premises environments. Boasting a versatile feature set, it offers seamless deployment options while delivering unparalleled performance.

A standout feature of SingleStoreDB is its advanced support for vector storage and operations, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring intricate AI capabilities such as text similarity matching. With built-in vector functions like [dot_product](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/dot_product.html) and [euclidean_distance](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/euclidean_distance.html), SingleStoreDB empowers developers to implement sophisticated algorithms efficiently.

For developers keen on leveraging vector data within SingleStoreDB, a comprehensive tutorial is available, guiding them through the intricacies of [working with vector data](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/developer-resources/functional-extensions/working-with-vector-data.html). This tutorial delves into the Vector Store within SingleStoreDB, showcasing its ability to facilitate searches based on vector similarity. Leveraging vector indexes, queries can be executed with remarkable speed, enabling swift retrieval of relevant data.

Moreover, SingleStoreDB's Vector Store seamlessly integrates with [full-text indexing based on Lucene](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/developer-resources/functional-extensions/working-with-full-text-search/), enabling powerful text similarity searches. Users can filter search results based on selected fields of document metadata objects, enhancing query precision.

What sets SingleStoreDB apart is its ability to combine vector and full-text searches in various ways, offering flexibility and versatility. Whether prefiltering by text or vector similarity and selecting the most relevant data, or employing a weighted sum approach to compute a final similarity score, developers have multiple options at their disposal.

In essence, SingleStoreDB provides a comprehensive solution for managing and querying vector data, offering unparalleled performance and flexibility for AI-driven applications.

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

LangChain.js requires the `mysql2` library to create a connection to a SingleStoreDB instance.

## Setup

1. Establish a SingleStoreDB environment. You have the flexibility to choose between [Cloud-based](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/getting-started-with-singlestoredb-cloud.html) or [On-Premise](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/v8.1/en/developer-resources/get-started-using-singlestoredb-for-free.html) editions.
2. Install the mysql2 JS client

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S mysql2
```

## Usage

`SingleStoreVectorStore` manages a connection pool. It is recommended to call `await store.end();` before terminating your application to assure all connections are appropriately closed and prevent any possible resource leaks.

### Standard usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import UsageExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/singlestore.ts";

Below is a straightforward example showcasing how to import the relevant module and perform a base similarity search using the `SingleStoreVectorStore`:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UsageExample}</CodeBlock>

### Metadata Filtering

import UsageExampleWithMetadata from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/singlestore_with_metadata_filter.ts";

If it is needed to filter results based on specific metadata fields, you can pass a filter parameter to narrow down your search to the documents that match all specified fields in the filter object:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UsageExampleWithMetadata}</CodeBlock>

### Vector indexes

Enhance your search efficiency with SingleStore DB version 8.5 or above by leveraging [ANN vector indexes](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/vector-indexing/).
By setting `useVectorIndex: true` during vector store object creation, you can activate this feature.
Additionally, if your vectors differ in dimensionality from the default OpenAI embedding size of 1536, ensure to specify the `vectorSize` parameter accordingly.

### Hybrid search

import HybridSearchUsageExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/singlestore_hybrid_search.ts";

SingleStoreDB presents a diverse range of search strategies, each meticulously crafted to cater to specific use cases and user preferences.
The default `VECTOR_ONLY` strategy utilizes vector operations such as `DOT_PRODUCT` or `EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE` to calculate similarity scores directly between vectors, while `TEXT_ONLY` employs Lucene-based full-text search, particularly advantageous for text-centric applications.
For users seeking a balanced approach, `FILTER_BY_TEXT` first refines results based on text similarity before conducting vector comparisons, whereas `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` prioritizes vector similarity, filtering results before assessing text similarity for optimal matches.
Notably, both `FILTER_BY_TEXT` and `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` necessitate a full-text index for operation. Additionally, `WEIGHTED_SUM` emerges as a sophisticated strategy, calculating the final similarity score by weighing vector and text similarities, albeit exclusively utilizing dot_product distance calculations and also requiring a full-text index.
These versatile strategies empower users to fine-tune searches according to their unique needs, facilitating efficient and precise data retrieval and analysis.
Moreover, SingleStoreDB's hybrid approaches, exemplified by `FILTER_BY_TEXT`, `FILTER_BY_VECTOR`, and `WEIGHTED_SUM` strategies, seamlessly blend vector and text-based searches to maximize efficiency and accuracy, ensuring users can fully leverage the platform's capabilities for a wide range of applications.

# Tigris

Tigris makes it easy to build AI applications with vector embeddings.
It is a fully managed cloud-native database that allows you store and
index documents and vector embeddings for fast and scalable vector search.

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

## Setup

### 1. Install the Tigris SDK

Install the SDK as follows

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @tigrisdata/vector
```

### 2. Fetch Tigris API credentials

You can sign up for a free Tigris account [here](https://www.tigrisdata.com/).

Once you have signed up for the Tigris account, create a new project called `vectordemo`.
Next, make a note of the `clientId` and `clientSecret`, which you can get from the
Application Keys section of the project.

## Index docs

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

# Turbopuffer

## Setup

First you must sign up for a Turbopuffer account [here](https://turbopuffer.com/join).
Then, once you have an account you can create an API key.

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import SimilaritySearchExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/turbopuffer.ts";

Here are some examples of how to use the class. You can filter your queries by previous specified metadata, but
keep in mind that currently only string values are supported.

See [here for more information](https://turbopuffer.com/docs/reference/query#filter-parameters) on acceptable filter formats.

# TypeORM

To enable vector search in a generic PostgreSQL database, LangChain.js supports using [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) with the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

## Setup

To work with TypeORM, you need to install the `typeorm` and `pg` packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install typeorm
```

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pg
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

### Setup a `pgvector` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`pgvector` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Postgres instance.
Create a file below named `docker-compose.yml`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DockerExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/typeorm_vectorstore/docker-compose.example.yml";

<CodeBlock language="yml" name="docker-compose.yml">
 {DockerExample}
</CodeBlock>

And then in the same directory, run `docker compose up` to start the container.

You can find more information on how to setup `pgvector` in the [official repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/typeorm_vectorstore/typeorm.ts";

One complete example of using `TypeORMVectorStore` is the following:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Typesense

Vector store that utilizes the Typesense search engine.

### Basic Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import {
 Typesense,
 TypesenseConfig,
} from "@lanchain/community/vectorstores/typesense";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Client } from "typesense";
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const vectorTypesenseClient = new Client({
 nodes: [
 {
 // Ideally should come from your .env file
 host: "...",
 port: 123,
 protocol: "https",
 },
 ],
 // Ideally should come from your .env file
 apiKey: "...",
 numRetries: 3,
 connectionTimeoutSeconds: 60,
});

const typesenseVectorStoreConfig = {
 // Typesense client
 typesenseClient: vectorTypesenseClient,
 // Name of the collection to store the vectors in
 schemaName: "your_schema_name",
 // Optional column names to be used in Typesense
 columnNames: {
 // "vec" is the default name for the vector column in Typesense but you can change it to whatever you want
 vector: "vec",
 // "text" is the default name for the text column in Typesense but you can change it to whatever you want
 pageContent: "text",
 // Names of the columns that you will save in your typesense schema and need to be retrieved as metadata when searching
 metadataColumnNames: ["foo", "bar", "baz"],
 },
 // Optional search parameters to be passed to Typesense when searching

 .collections(collectionName)
 .documents()
 .import(data, { action: "emplace", dirty_values: "drop" });
 },
} satisfies TypesenseConfig;

/**
 * Creates a Typesense vector store from a list of documents.
 * Will update documents if there is a document with the same id, at least with the default import function.

// Do a similarity search
const vectorStore = await getVectorStoreWithTypesense();
const documents = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("hello world");

// Add filters based on metadata with the search parameters of Typesense
// will exclude documents with author:JK Rowling, so if Joe Rowling & JK Rowling exists, only Joe Rowling will be returned
vectorStore.similaritySearch("Rowling", undefined, {
 filter_by: "author:!=JK Rowling",
});

// Delete a document
vectorStore.deleteDocuments(["document_id_1", "document_id_2"]);
```

### Constructor

Before starting, create a schema in Typesense with an id, a field for the vector and a field for the text. Add as many other fields as needed for the metadata.

- `constructor(embeddings: Embeddings, config: TypesenseConfig)`: Constructs a new instance of the `Typesense` class.
 - `embeddings`: An instance of the `Embeddings` class used for embedding documents.
 - `config`: Configuration object for the Typesense vector store.
 - `typesenseClient`: Typesense client instance.
 - `schemaName`: Name of the Typesense schema in which documents will be stored and searched.
 - `searchParams` (optional): Typesense search parameters. Default is `{ q: '*', per_page: 5, query_by: '' }`.
 - `columnNames` (optional): Column names configuration.
 - `vector` (optional): Vector column name. Default is `'vec'`.
 - `pageContent` (optional): Page content column name. Default is `'text'`.
 - `metadataColumnNames` (optional): Metadata column names. Default is an empty array `[]`.
 - `import` (optional): Replace the default import function for importing data to Typesense. This can affect the functionality of updating documents.

### Methods

- `async addDocuments(documents: Document[]): Promise<void>`: Adds documents to the vector store. The documents will be updated if there is a document with the same ID.
- `static async fromDocuments(docs: Document[], embeddings: Embeddings, config: TypesenseConfig): Promise<Typesense>`: Creates a Typesense vector store from a list of documents. Documents are added to the vector store during construction.
- `static async fromTexts(texts: string[], metadatas: object[], embeddings: Embeddings, config: TypesenseConfig): Promise<Typesense>`: Creates a Typesense vector store from a list of texts and associated metadata. Texts are converted to documents and added to the vector store during construction.
- `async similaritySearch(query: string, k?: number, filter?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Document[]>`: Searches for similar documents based on a query. Returns an array of similar documents.
- `async deleteDocuments(documentIds: string[]): Promise<void>`: Deletes documents from the vector store based on their IDs.

# Vectara

Vectara is a platform for building GenAI applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying that is managed by Vectara and is optimized for performance and accuracy.

You can use Vectara as a vector store with LangChain.js.

## 👉 Embeddings Included

Vectara uses its own embeddings under the hood, so you don't have to provide any yourself or call another service to obtain embeddings.

This also means that if you provide your own embeddings, they'll be a no-op.

```typescript
const store = await VectaraStore.fromTexts(
 ["hello world", "hi there"],
 [{ foo: "bar" }, { foo: "baz" }],
 // This won't have an effect. Provide a FakeEmbeddings instance instead for clarity.
 new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
 args
);
```

## Setup

You'll need to:

- Create a [free Vectara account](https://vectara.com/integrations/langchain).
- Create a [corpus](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/creating-a-corpus) to store your data
- Create an [API key](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/common-use-cases/app-authn-authz/api-keys) with QueryService and IndexService access so you can access this corpus

Configure your `.env` file or provide args to connect LangChain to your Vectara corpus:

```
VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID=your_customer_id
VECTARA_CORPUS_ID=your_corpus_id
VECTARA_API_KEY=your-vectara-api-key
```

Note that you can provide multiple corpus IDs separated by commas for querying multiple corpora at once. For example: `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID=3,8,9,43`.
For indexing multiple corpora, you'll need to create a separate VectaraStore instance for each corpus.

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/vectara.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

Note that `lambda` is a parameter related to Vectara's hybrid search capbility, providing a tradeoff between neural search and boolean/exact match as described [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching). We recommend the value of 0.025 as a default, while providing a way for advanced users to customize this value if needed.

## APIs

Vectara's LangChain vector store consumes Vectara's core APIs:

- [Indexing API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/indexing-apis/indexing) for storing documents in a Vectara corpus.
- [Search API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/search-apis/search) for querying this data. This API supports hybrid search.

# Vercel Postgres

LangChain.js supports using the [`@vercel/postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/postgres) package to use generic Postgres databases
as vector stores, provided they support the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

This integration is particularly useful from web environments like Edge functions.

## Setup

To work with Vercel Postgres, you need to install the `@vercel/postgres` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @vercel/postgres
```

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

This integration automatically connects using the connection string set under `process.env.POSTGRES_URL`.
You can also pass a connection string manually like this:

```typescript
const vectorstore = await VercelPostgres.initialize(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {
 postgresConnectionOptions: {
 connectionString:
 "postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<dbname>",
 },
});
```

### Connecting to Vercel Postgres

A simple way to get started is to create a serverless [Vercel Postgres instance](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart).
If you're deploying to a Vercel project with an associated Vercel Postgres instance, the required `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable
will already be populated in hosted environments.

### Connecting to other databases

If you prefer to host your own Postgres instance, you can use a similar flow to LangChain's [PGVector](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector)
vectorstore integration and set the connection string either as an environment variable or as shown above.

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/vercel_postgres/example.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

# Xata

[Xata](https://xata.io) is a serverless data platform, based on PostgreSQL. It provides a type-safe TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data.

Xata has a native vector type, which can be added to any table, and supports similarity search. LangChain inserts vectors directly to Xata, and queries it for the nearest neighbors of a given vector, so that you can use all the LangChain Embeddings integrations with Xata.

## Setup

### Install the Xata CLI

```bash
npm install @xata.io/cli -g
```

### Create a database to be used as a vector store

In the [Xata UI](https://app.xata.io) create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, but for this example we'll use `langchain`.
Create a table, again you can name it anything, but we will use `vectors`. Add the following columns via the UI:

- `content` of type "Text". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values.
- `embedding` of type "Vector". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use (1536 for OpenAI).
- any other columns you want to use as metadata. They are populated from the `Document.metadata` object. For example, if in the `Document.metadata` object you have a `title` property, you can create a `title` column in the table and it will be populated.

### Initialize the project

In your project, run:

```bash
xata init
```

and then choose the database you created above. This will also generate a `xata.ts` or `xata.js` file that defines the client you can use to interact with the database. See the [Xata getting started docs](https://xata.io/docs/getting-started/installation) for more details on using the Xata JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.

## Usage

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

### Example: Q&A chatbot using OpenAI and Xata as vector store

This example uses the `VectorDBQAChain` to search the documents stored in Xata and then pass them as context to the OpenAI model, in order to answer the question asked by the user.

import FromDocs from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/xata.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FromDocs}</CodeBlock>

### Example: Similarity search with a metadata filter

This example shows how to implement semantic search using LangChain.js and Xata. Before running it, make sure to add an `author` column of type String to the `vectors` table in Xata.

import SimSearch from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/xata_metadata.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SimSearch}</CodeBlock>

# Zep Cloud

> [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
> With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
> while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

**Note:** The `ZepCloudVectorStore` works with `Documents` and is intended to be used as a `Retriever`.
It offers separate functionality to Zep's `ZepCloudMemory` class, which is designed for persisting, enriching
and searching your user's chat history.

## Why Zep's VectorStore? 🤖🚀

Zep automatically embeds documents added to the Zep Vector Store using low-latency models local to the Zep server.
The Zep TS/JS client can be used in non-Node edge environments. These two together with Zep's chat memory functionality
make Zep ideal for building conversational LLM apps where latency and performance are important.

### Supported Search Types

Zep supports both similarity search and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search. MMR search is particularly useful
for Retrieval Augmented Generation applications as it re-ranks results to ensure diversity in the returned documents.

## Installation

Sign up for [Zep Cloud](https://app.getzep.com/) and create a project.

Follow the [Zep Cloud Typescript SDK Installation Guide](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) to install and get started with Zep.

## Usage

You'll need your Zep Cloud Project API Key to use the Zep VectorStore. See the [Zep Cloud docs](https://help.getzep.com/projects) for more information.

Zep auto embeds all documents by default, and it's not expecting to receive any embeddings from the user.
Since LangChain requires passing in a `Embeddings` instance, we pass in `FakeEmbeddings`.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

### Example: Creating a ZepVectorStore from Documents & Querying

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @getzep/zep-cloud @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

import ZepCloudVectorStoreExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/zep/zep_cloud.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ZepCloudVectorStoreExample}</CodeBlock>

### Example: Using ZepCloudVectorStore with Expression Language

import ZepCloudVectorStoreExpressionLanguageExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/zep/zep_cloud_vector_store.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
 {ZepCloudVectorStoreExpressionLanguageExample}

## Installation

Follow the [Zep Open Source Quickstart Guide](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/quickstart/) to install and get started with Zep.

## Usage

You'll need your Zep API URL and optionally an API key to use the Zep VectorStore. See the [Zep docs](https://docs.getzep.com) for more information.

In the examples below, we're using Zep's auto-embedding feature which automatically embed documents on the Zep server using
low-latency embedding models. Since LangChain requires passing in a `Embeddings` instance, we pass in `FakeEmbeddings`.

**Note:** If you pass in an `Embeddings` instance other than `FakeEmbeddings`, this class will be used to embed documents.
You must also set your document collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`. See the `OpenAIEmbeddings` example below.

### Example: Creating a ZepVectorStore from Documents & Querying

# INVALID_PROMPT_INPUT

A [prompt template](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates) received missing or invalid input variables.

One unexpected way this can occur is if you add a JSON object directly into a prompt template:

```ts
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`You are a helpful assistant.

Here is an example of how you should respond:

{
 "firstName": "John",
 "lastName": "Doe",
 "age": 21
}

Now, answer the following question:

{question}`);
```

You might think that the above prompt template should require a single input key named `question`, but the JSON object will be
interpreted as an additional variable because the curly braces (`{`) are not escaped, and should be preceded by a second brace instead, like this:

```ts
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`You are a helpful assistant.

Here is an example of how you should respond:

{{
 "firstName": "John",
 "lastName": "Doe",
 "age": 21
}}

Now, answer the following question:

{question}`);
```

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Double-check your prompt template to ensure that it is correct.
 - If you are using default formatting and you are using curly braces `{` anywhere in your template, they should be double escaped like this: `{{`, as shown above.
- If you are using a [`MessagesPlaceholder`](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates/#messagesplaceholder), make sure that you are passing in an array of messages or message-like objects.
 - If you are using shorthand tuples to declare your prompt template, make sure that the variable name is wrapped in curly braces (`["placeholder", "{messages}"]`).
- Try viewing the inputs into your prompt template using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) or log statements to confirm they appear as expected.
- If you are pulling a prompt from the [LangChain Prompt Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/prompts), try pulling and logging it or running it in isolation with a sample input to confirm that it is what you expect.

# MESSAGE_COERCION_FAILURE

Several modules in LangChain take [`MessageLike`](https://api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages.BaseMessageLike.html)
objects in place of formal [`BaseMessage`](/docs/concepts/messages) classes. These include OpenAI style message objects (`{ role: "user", content: "Hello world!" }`),
tuples, and plain strings (which are converted to [`HumanMessages`](/docs/concepts/messages/#humanmessage)).

If one of these modules receives a value outside of one of these formats, you will receive an error like the following:

```ts
const badlyFormattedMessageObject = {
 role: "foo",
 randomNonContentValue: "bar",
};

await model.invoke([badlyFormattedMessageObject]);
```

```
Error: Unable to coerce message from array: only human, AI, system, or tool message coercion is currently supported.

Received: {
 "role": "foo",
 "randomNonContentValue": "bar",
}
```

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Ensure that all inputs to chat models are an array of LangChain message classes or a supported message-like.
 - Check that there is no stringification or other unexpected transformation occuring.
- Check the error's stack trace and add log or debugger statements.
```

# MODEL_AUTHENTICATION

Your model provider is denying you access to their service.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Confirm that your API key or other credentials are correct.
- If you are relying on an environment variable to authenticate, confirm that the variable name is correct and that it has a value set.
 - Note that some environments, like Cloudflare Workers, do not support environment variables.
 - For some models, you can try explicitly passing an `apiKey` parameter to rule out any environment variable issues like this:

```ts
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
 apiKey: "YOUR_KEY_HERE",
});
```

- If you are using a proxy or other custom endpoint, make sure that your custom provider does not expect an alternative authentication scheme.

# MODEL_NOT_FOUND

The model name you have specified is not acknowledged by your provider.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Double check the model string you are passing in.
- If you are using a proxy or other alternative host with a model wrapper, confirm that the permitted model names are not restricted or altered.
```

# MODEL_RATE_LIMIT

You have hit the maximum number of requests that a model provider allows over a given time period and are being temporarily blocked.
Generally, this error is temporary and your limit will reset after a certain amount of time.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Contact your model provider and ask for a rate limit increase.
- If many of your incoming requests are the same, utilize [model response caching](/docs/how_to/chat_model_caching/).
- Spread requests across different providers if your application allows it.
- Set a higher number of [max retries](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/_langchain_core.language_models_base.BaseLanguageModelParams.html#maxRetries) when initializing your model.
 LangChain will use an exponential backoff strategy for requests that fail in this way, so the retry may occur when your limits have reset.

```markdown for jsx
# OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE

An [output parser](/docs/concepts/output_parsers) was unable to handle model output as expected.

To illustrate this, let's say you have an output parser that expects a chat model to output JSON surrounded by a markdown code tag (triple backticks). Here would be an example of good input:

````ts
AIMessage {
 content: "```\n{\"foo\": \"bar\"}\n```"
}
````

Internally, our output parser might try to strip out the markdown fence and newlines and then run `JSON.parse()`.

If instead the chat model generated an output with malformed JSON like this:

````ts
AIMessage {
 content: "```\n{\"foo\":\n```"
}
````

When our output parser attempts to parse this, the `JSON.parse()` call will fail.

Note that some prebuilt constructs like [legacy LangChain agents](/docs/how_to/agent_executor) and chains may use output parsers internally,
so you may see this error even if you're not visibly instantiating and using an output parser.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- Consider using [tool calling or other structured output techniques](/docs/how_to/structured_output/) if possible without an output parser to reliably output parseable values.
 - If you are using a prebuilt chain or agent, use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) to compose your logic explicitly instead.
- Add more precise formatting instructions to your prompt. In the above example, adding `"You must always return valid JSON fenced by a markdown code block. Do not return any additional text."` to your input may help steer the model to returning the expected format.
- If you are using a smaller or less capable model, try using a more capable one.
- Add [LLM-powered retries](/docs/how_to/output_parser_fixing/).

 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "We'll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. \n",
 "This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions.\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation.\n",
 "There are several other related concepts that you may be looking for:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Conversational RAG](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data\n",
 "- [Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/): Build a chatbot that can take actions\n",
 "\n",
 "This tutorial will cover the basics which will be helpful for those two more advanced topics, but feel free to skip directly to there should you choose.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
 "\n",
 "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "For this tutorial we will need `@langchain/core` and `langgraph`:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from \"@theme/Npm2Yarn\"\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph uuid\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",

 "## Managing Conversation History\n",
 "\n",
 "One important concept to understand when building chatbots is how to manage conversation history. If left unmanaged, the list of messages will grow unbounded and potentially overflow the context window of the LLM. Therefore, it is important to add a step that limits the size of the messages you are passing in.\n",
 "\n",
 "**Importantly, you will want to do this BEFORE the prompt template but AFTER you load previous messages from Message History.**\n",
 "\n",
 "We can do this by adding a simple step in front of the prompt that modifies the `messages` key appropriately, and then wrap that new chain in the Message History class. \n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain comes with a few built-in helpers for [managing a list of messages](/docs/how_to/#messages). In this case we'll use the [trimMessages](/docs/how_to/trim_messages/) helper to reduce how many messages we're sending to the model. The trimmer allows us to specify how many tokens we want to keep, along with other parameters like if we want to always keep the system message and whether to allow partial messages:"

 "# Build a Question Answering application over a Graph Database\n",
 "\n",
 "In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A chain over a graph database. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a graph database and get back a natural language answer.\n",
 "\n",
 "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
 "\n",
 "Building Q&A systems of graph databases requires executing model-generated graph queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "## Architecture\n",
 "\n",
 "At a high-level, the steps of most graph chains are:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. **Convert question to a graph database query**: Model converts user input to a graph database query (e.g. Cypher).\n",
 "2. **Execute graph database query**: Execute the graph database query.\n",
 "3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.\n",

# Tutorials

New to LangChain or LLM app development in general? Read this material to quickly get up and running building your first applications.

## Get started

Familiarize yourself with LangChain's open-source components by building simple applications.

If you're looking to get started with [chat models](/docs/integrations/chat/), [vector stores](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/),
or other LangChain components from a specific provider, check out our supported [integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/).

- [Chat models and prompts](/docs/tutorials/llm_chain): Build a simple LLM application with [prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates) and [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models).
- [Semantic search](/docs/tutorials/retrievers): Build a semantic search engine over a PDF with [document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders), [embedding models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/), and [vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores/).
- [Classification](/docs/tutorials/classification): Classify text into categories or labels using [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) with [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/).
- [Extraction](/docs/tutorials/extraction): Extract structured data from text and other unstructured media using [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) and [few-shot examples](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/).

Refer to the [how-to guides](/docs/how_to) for more detail on using all LangChain components.

## Orchestration

Get started using [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) to assemble LangChain components into full-featured applications.

- [Chatbots](/docs/tutorials/chatbot): Build a chatbot that incorporates memory.
- [Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/): Build an agent with LangGraph.js that interacts with external tools.
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag): Build an application that uses your own documents to inform its responses.
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Part 2](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Build a RAG application that incorporates a memory of its user interactions and multi-step retrieval.
- [Question-Answering with SQL](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa): Build a question-answering system that executes SQL queries to inform its responses.
- [Summarization](/docs/tutorials/summarization): Generate summaries of (potentially long) texts.
- [Question-Answering with Graph Databases](/docs/tutorials/graph): Build a question-answering system that queries a graph database to inform its responses.

## LangSmith

LangSmith allows you to closely trace, monitor and evaluate your LLM application.
It seamlessly integrates with LangChain, and you can use it to inspect and debug individual steps of your chains as you build.

LangSmith documentation is hosted on a separate site.
You can peruse [LangSmith tutorials here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tutorials/).

### Evaluation

LangSmith helps you evaluate the performance of your LLM applications. The below tutorial is a great way to get started:

- [Evaluate your LLM application](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tutorials/Developers/evaluation)

 "# Build a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates\n",
 "\n",
 "In this quickstart we'll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\n",
 "\n",
 "After reading this tutorial, you'll have a high level overview of:\n",
 "\n",
 "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
 "\n",
 "- Using [prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)\n",
 "\n",
 "- Debugging and tracing your application using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)\n",
 "\n",
 "Let's dive in!\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "To install LangChain run:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';\n",
 "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
 "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " langchain @langchain/core\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation/).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
 "\n",
 "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
 "\n",
 "```shell\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
 "\n",
 "# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment\n",
 "# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true\n",

 "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 2\n",
 "\n",
 "In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\n",
 "\n",
 "This is a the second part of a multi-part tutorial:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\n",
 "- [Part 2](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history) (this guide) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\n",
 "\n",
 "Here we focus on **adding logic for incorporating historical messages.** This involves the management of a [chat history](/docs/concepts/chat_history).\n",
 "\n",
 "We will cover two approaches:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. [Chains](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/#chains), in which we execute at most one retrieval step;\n",
 "2. [Agents](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/#agents), in which we give an LLM discretion to execute multiple retrieval steps.\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 ":::note\n",
 "\n",
 "The methods presented here leverage [tool-calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) capabilities in modern [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models). See [this page](/docs/integrations/chat/) for a table of models supporting tool calling features.\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",

 "For the external knowledge source, we will use the same [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng from the [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) of the RAG tutorial."

 "In the [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) of the RAG tutorial, we represented the user input, retrieved context, and generated answer as separate keys in the state. Conversational experiences can be naturally represented using a sequence of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages/). In addition to messages from the user and assistant, retrieved documents and other artifacts can be incorporated into a message sequence via [tool messages](/docs/concepts/messages/#toolmessage). This motivates us to represent the state of our RAG application using a sequence of messages. Specifically, we will have\n",

 "Leveraging [tool-calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) to interact with a retrieval step has another benefit, which is that the query for the retrieval is generated by our model.

 "\n",
 "The standard method for task decomposition involves breaking down hard tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can be achieved through various approaches:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This method transforms large tasks into multiple manageable tasks, providing insight into the model's reasoning process.\n",
 "2. **Prompting**: Using simple prompts like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" to guide the decomposition.\n",
 "3. **Task-Specific Instructions**: Providing specific instructions tailored to the task, such as \"Write a story outline\" for writing a novel.\n",
 "4. **Human Inputs**: Involving human input to assist in the decomposition process.\n",

 "\n",
 "1. **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**: This method extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

 "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 1\n",
 "\n",
 "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag/).\n",
 "\n",
 "This is a multi-part tutorial:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) (this guide) introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\n",
 "- [Part 2](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\n",
 "\n",
 "This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\n",
 "over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A\n",
 "architecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see\n",
 "how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\n",
 "LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\n",
 "complexity.\n",
 "\n",
 "If you're already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\n",
 "this [high-level overview of different retrieval techinques](/docs/concepts/retrieval).\n",
 "\n",
 "**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing [question/answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa).\n",
 "\n",
 "## Overview\n",
 "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
 "\n",
 "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
 "\n",
 "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
 "\n",
 "Note: the indexing portion of this tutorial will largely follow the [semantic search tutorial](/docs/tutorials/retrievers).\n",
 "\n",
 "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
 "\n",
 "### Indexing\n",
 "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with [Document Loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders).\n",
 "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
 "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) and [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) model.\n",
 "\n",
 "![index_diagram](../../static/img/rag_indexing.png)\n",
 "\n",
 "### Retrieval and generation\n",
 "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers).\n",
 "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/concepts/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/concepts/text_llms) produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\n",
 "\n",
 "![retrieval_diagram](../../static/img/rag_retrieval_generation.png)\n",
 "\n",
 "Once we've indexed our data, we will use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) as our orchestration framework to implement the retrieval and generation steps.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
 "\n",
 "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide requires the following dependencies:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " langchain @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
 "\n",
 "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
 "\n",
 "```shell\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",

The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain'\u001b[39m,\n",

 " pageContent: \u001b[32m'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al.'\u001b[39m,\n",

 "\n",
 "- In addition to semantic search, we can build in structured filters (e.g., \"Find documents since the year 2020.\");\n",

 "[Query analysis](/docs/concepts/retrieval/#query-analysis) employs models to transform or construct optimized search queries from raw user input. We can easily incorporate a query analysis step into our application. For illustrative purposes, let's add some metadata to the documents in our vector store.

 "# Build a semantic search engine\n",
 "\n",
 "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's [document loader](/docs/concepts/document_loaders), [embedding](/docs/concepts/embedding_models), and [vector store](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data-- from (vector) databases and other sources-- for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag) (see our RAG tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/rag)).\n",
 "\n",
 "Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Concepts\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- Documents and document loaders;\n",
 "- Text splitters;\n",
 "- Embeddings;\n",
 "- Vector stores and retrievers.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
 "\n",
 "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide requires `@langchain/community` and `pdf-parse`:\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",
 "import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';\n",
 "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
 "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",
 "\n",
 "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
 " @langchain/community pdf-parse\n",
 "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation/).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
 "\n",
 "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
 "\n",
 "```shell\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
 "export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
 "\n",
 "# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment\n",
 "# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "## Documents and Document Loaders\n",
 "\n",
 "LangChain implements a [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has three attributes:\n",
 "\n",
 "- `pageContent`: a string representing the content;\n",
 "- `metadata`: records of arbitrary metadata;\n",
 "- `id`: (optional) a string identifier for the document.\n",
 "\n",
 "The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual `Document` object often represents a chunk of a larger document.\n",
 "\n",
 "We can generate sample documents when desired:\n",
 "```javascript\n",
 "import { Document } from \"@langchain/core/documents\";\n",
 "\n",
 "const documents = [\n",
 " new Document({\n",
 " pageContent: \"Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.\",\n",
 " metadata: {\"source\": \"mammal-pets-doc\"},\n",
 " }),\n",
 " new Document({\n",

 "# Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data\n",
 "\n",
 ":::info Prerequisites\n",
 "\n",
 "This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:\n",
 "\n",
 "- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)\n",
 "- [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)\n",
 "- [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)\n",
 "- [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture/#langgraph)\n",
 "\n",
 ":::\n",
 "\n",
 "Enabling a LLM system to query structured data can be qualitatively different from unstructured text data. Whereas in the latter it is common to generate text that can be searched against a vector database, the approach for structured data is often for the LLM to write and execute queries in a DSL, such as SQL. In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both [chains](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa#chains) and [agents](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa#agents). These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.\n",
 "\n",
 "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
 "\n",
 "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
 "\n",
 "\n",
 "## Architecture\n",
 "\n",
 "At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. **Convert question to SQL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.\n",
 "2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the query.\n",
 "3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.\n",
 "\n",
 "![sql_usecase.png](../../static/img/sql_usecase.png)\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "First, get required packages and set environment variables:\n",
 "```bash npm2yarn\n",
 "npm i langchain @langchain/community @langchain/langgraph\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "```shell\n",
 "# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required, but recommended for debugging and observability.\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your key>\n",
 "# export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\n",

 "\n",
 "Concepts we will cover are:\n",
 "\n",
 "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models).\n",
 "\n",
 "- Using [document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders), specifically the [CheerioWebBaseLoader](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.document_loaders_web_cheerio.CheerioWebBaseLoader.html) to load content from an HTML webpage.\n",
 "\n",
 "- Two ways to summarize or otherwise combine documents.\n",
 " 1. [Stuff](/docs/tutorials/summarization#stuff), which simply concatenates documents into a prompt;\n",
 " 2. [Map-reduce](/docs/tutorials/summarization#map-reduce), for larger sets of documents. This splits documents into batches, summarizes those, and then summarizes the summaries.\n",
 "\n",
 "## Setup\n",
 "\n",
 "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
 "\n",
 "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Installation\n",
 "\n",
 "To install LangChain run:\n",
 "\n",
 "```bash npm2yarn\n",
 "npm i langchain @langchain/core\n",
 "```\n",
 "\n",
 "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
 "\n",
 "### LangSmith\n",
 "\n",
 "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
 "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
 "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
 "\n",
 "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",

 "## Overview\n",
 "\n",
 "A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM's context window. Two common approaches for this are:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. `Stuff`: Simply \"stuff\" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach.\n",
 "\n",
 "2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on its own in a \"map\" step and then \"reduce\" the summaries into a final summary.\n",
 "\n",
 "Note that map-reduce is especially effective when understanding of a sub-document does not rely on preceding context. For example, when summarizing a corpus of many, shorter documents. In other cases, such as summarizing a novel or body of text with an inherent sequence, [iterative refinement](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/summarization/) may be more effective."

 "The retrieved documents discuss the development and capabilities of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Here are the main themes:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. **LLM as a Core Controller**: LLMs are positioned as the central intelligence in autonomous agent systems, capable of performing complex tasks beyond simple text generation. They can be framed as general problem solvers, with various implementations like AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer, and BabyAGI serving as proof-of-concept demonstrations.\n",
 "\n",
 "2. **Task Decomposition and Planning**: Effective task management is crucial for LLMs. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) are highlighted for breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths, enhancing the agent's problem-solving capabilities.\n",
 "\n",
 "3. **Integration of External Tools**: The use of external tools significantly enhances LLM capabilities. Frameworks like MRKL and Toolformer allow LLMs to interact with various APIs and tools, improving their performance in specific tasks. This modular approach enables LLMs to route inquiries to specialized modules, combining neural and symbolic reasoning.\n",
 "\n",
 "4. **Self-Reflection and Learning**: Self-reflection mechanisms are essential for agents to learn from past actions and improve over time. Approaches like ReAct and Reflexion integrate reasoning with action, allowing agents to evaluate their performance and adjust strategies based on feedback.\n",
 "\n",
 "5. **Memory and Context Management**: The documents discuss different types of memory (sensory, short-term, long-term) and their relevance to LLMs. The challenge of finite context length in LLMs is emphasized, as it limits the ability to retain and utilize historical information effectively. Techniques like external memory storage and vector databases are suggested to mitigate these limitations.\n",
 "\n",
 "6. **Challenges and Limitations**: Several challenges are identified, including the reliability of natural language interfaces, difficulties in long-term planning, and the need for robust task decomposition. The documents note that LLMs may struggle with unexpected errors and formatting issues, which can hinder their performance in real-world applications.\n",
 "\n",
 "7. **Emerging Applications**: The potential applications of LLM-powered agents are explored, including scientific discovery, autonomous design, and interactive simulations (e.g., generative agents mimicking human behavior). These applications demonstrate the versatility and innovative possibilities of LLMs in various domains.\n",
 "\n",
 "Overall, the documents present a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM-powered autonomous agents, highlighting their capabilities, methodologies, and the challenges they face in practical implementations.\n"

# LangChain releases

The LangChain ecosystem is composed of different component packages (e.g., `@langchain/core`, `langchain`, `@langchain/community`, `@langchain/langgraph`, partner packages etc.)

## Versioning

### `langchain` and `@langchain/core`

`langchain` and `@langchain/core` follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in the format of 0.**Y**.**Z**. The packages are under rapid development, and so are currently versioning the packages with a major version of 0.

Minor version increases will occur for:

- Breaking changes for any public interfaces marked as `beta`.

Patch version increases will occur for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Any changes to private interfaces
- Any changes to `beta` features

When upgrading between minor versions, users should review the list of breaking changes and deprecations.

From time to time, we will version packages as **release candidates**. These are versions that are intended to be released as stable versions, but we want to get feedback from the community before doing so.
Release candidates will be versioned as 0.**Y**.**Z**-rc**.N**. For example, `0.2.0-rc.1`. If no issues are found, the release candidate will be released as a stable version with the same version number.
\If issues are found, we will release a new release candidate with an incremented `N` value (e.g., `0.2.0-rc.2`).

### Other packages in the langchain ecosystem

Other packages in the ecosystem (including user packages) can follow a different versioning scheme, but are generally expected to pin to specific minor versions of `langchain` and `@langchain/core`.

## Release cadence

We expect to space out **minor** releases (e.g., from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0) of `langchain` and `@langchain/core` by at least 2-3 months, as such releases may contain breaking changes.

Patch versions are released frequently as they contain bug fixes and new features.

## API stability

The development of LLM applications is a rapidly evolving field, and we are constantly learning from our users and the community. As such, we expect that the APIs in `langchain` and `@langchain/core` will continue to evolve to better serve the needs of our users.

Even though both `langchain` and `@langchain/core` are currently in a pre-1.0 state, we are committed to maintaining API stability in these packages.

- Breaking changes to the public API will result in a minor version bump (the second digit)
- Any bug fixes or new features will result in a patch version bump (the third digit)

We will generally try to avoid making unnecessary changes, and will provide a deprecation policy for features that are being removed.

### Stability of other packages

The stability of other packages in the LangChain ecosystem may vary:

- `@langchain/community` is a community maintained package that contains 3rd party integrations. While we do our best to review and test changes in `@langchain/community`, `@langchain/community` is expected to experience more breaking changes than `langchain` and `@langchain/core` as it contains many community contributions.
- Partner packages may follow different stability and versioning policies, and users should refer to the documentation of those packages for more information; however, in general these packages are expected to be stable.

### What is a "API stability"?

API stability means:

- All the public APIs (everything in this documentation) will not be moved or renamed without providing backwards-compatible aliases.
- If new features are added to these APIs – which is quite possible – they will not break or change the meaning of existing methods. In other words, "stable" does not (necessarily) mean "complete."
- If, for some reason, an API declared stable must be removed or replaced, it will be declared deprecated but will remain in the API for at least two minor releases. Warnings will be issued when the deprecated method is called.

### **APIs marked as internal**

Certain APIs are explicitly marked as “internal” in a couple of ways:

- Some documentation refers to internals and mentions them as such. If the documentation says that something is internal, it may change.
- Functions, methods, and other objects prefixed by a leading underscore (**`_`**). If any method starts with a single **`_`**, it’s an internal API.
 - **Exception:** Certain methods are prefixed with `_` , but do not contain an implementation. These methods are _meant_ to be overridden by sub-classes that provide the implementation. Such methods are generally part of the **Public API** of LangChain.

## Deprecation policy

We will generally avoid deprecating features until a better alternative is available.

When a feature is deprecated, it will continue to work in the current and next minor version of `langchain` and `@langchain/core`. After that, the feature will be removed.

Since we're expecting to space out minor releases by at least 2-3 months, this means that a feature can be removed within 2-6 months of being deprecated.

In some situations, we may allow the feature to remain in the code base for longer periods of time, if it's not causing issues in the packages, to reduce the burden on users.

 "## LCEL: Add a preprocessing step\n",
 "\n",
 "The simplest way to add complex conversation management is by introducing a pre-processing step in front of the chat model and pass the full conversation history to the pre-processing step.\n",
 "\n",
 "This approach is conceptually simple and will work in many situations; for example, if using a [RunnableWithMessageHistory](/docs/how_to/message_history/) instead of wrapping the chat model, wrap the chat model with the pre-processor.\n",
 "\n",
 "The obvious downside of this approach is that latency starts to increase as the conversation history grows because of two reasons:\n",
 "\n",
 "1. As the conversation gets longer, more data may need to be fetched from whatever store your'e using to store the conversation history (if not storing it in memory).\n",
 "2. The pre-processing logic will end up doing a lot of redundant computation, repeating computation from previous steps of the conversation.\n",
 "\n",
 "```{=mdx}\n",

# How to migrate to LangGraph memory

As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of LangGraph persistence to incorporate `memory` into their LangChain application.

- Users that rely on `RunnableWithMessageHistory` or `BaseChatMessageHistory` do **not** need to make any changes, but are encouraged to consider using LangGraph for more complex use cases.
- Users that rely on deprecated memory abstractions from LangChain 0.0.x should follow this guide to upgrade to the new LangGraph persistence feature in LangChain 0.3.x.

## Why use LangGraph for memory?

The main advantages of persistence in LangGraph are:

- Built-in support for multiple users and conversations, which is a typical requirement for real-world conversational AI applications.
- Ability to save and resume complex conversations at any point. This helps with:
 - Error recovery
 - Allowing human intervention in AI workflows
 - Exploring different conversation paths ("time travel")
- Full compatibility with both traditional [language models](/docs/concepts/text_llms) and modern [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models). Early memory implementations in LangChain weren't designed for newer chat model APIs, causing issues with features like tool-calling. LangGraph memory can persist any custom state.
- Highly customizable, allowing you to fully control how memory works and use different storage backends.

## Evolution of memory in LangChain

The concept of memory has evolved significantly in LangChain since its initial release.

### LangChain 0.0.x memory

Broadly speaking, LangChain 0.0.x memory was used to handle three main use cases:

| Use Case | Example |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Managing conversation history | Keep only the last `n` turns of the conversation between the user and the AI. |
| Extraction of structured information | Extract structured information from the conversation history, such as a list of facts learned about the user. |
| Composite memory implementations | Combine multiple memory sources, e.g., a list of known facts about the user along with facts learned during a given conversation. |

While the LangChain 0.0.x memory abstractions were useful, they were limited in their capabilities and not well suited for real-world conversational AI applications. These memory abstractions lacked built-in support for multi-user, multi-conversation scenarios, which are essential for practical conversational AI systems.

Most of these implementations have been officially deprecated in LangChain 0.3.x in favor of LangGraph persistence.

### RunnableWithMessageHistory and BaseChatMessageHistory

:::note
Please see [How to use BaseChatMessageHistory with LangGraph](./chat_history), if you would like to use `BaseChatMessageHistory` (with or without `RunnableWithMessageHistory`) in LangGraph.
:::

As of LangChain v0.1, we started recommending that users rely primarily on [BaseChatMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.chat_history.BaseChatMessageHistory.html). `BaseChatMessageHistory` serves
as a simple persistence for storing and retrieving messages in a conversation.

At that time, the only option for orchestrating LangChain chains was via [LCEL](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel). To incorporate memory with `LCEL`, users had to use the [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html) interface. While sufficient for basic chat applications, many users found the API unintuitive and challenging to use.

As of LangChain v0.3, we recommend that **new** code takes advantage of LangGraph for both orchestration and persistence:

- Orchestration: In LangGraph, users define [graphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/) that specify the flow of the application. This allows users to keep using `LCEL` within individual nodes when `LCEL` is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.
- Persistence: Users can rely on LangGraph's persistence to store and retrieve data. LangGraph persistence is extremely flexible and can support a much wider range of use cases than the `RunnableWithMessageHistory` interface.

:::important
If you have been using `RunnableWithMessageHistory` or `BaseChatMessageHistory`, you do not need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating either functionality in the near future. This functionality is sufficient for simple chat applications and any code that uses `RunnableWithMessageHistory` will continue to work as expected.
:::

## Migrations

:::info Prerequisites

These guides assume some familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)
- [v0.0.x Memory](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/memory/)
- [How to add persistence ("memory") to your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/persistence/)

:::

### 1. Managing conversation history

The goal of managing conversation history is to store and retrieve the history in a way that is optimal for a chat model to use.

Often this involves trimming and / or summarizing the conversation history to keep the most relevant parts of the conversation while having the conversation fit inside the context window of the chat model.

Memory classes that fall into this category include:

| Memory Type | How to Migrate | Description |
| --------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConversationTokenBufferMemory` | [Link to Migration Guide](conversation_buffer_window_memory) | Keeps only the most recent messages in the conversation under the constraint that the total number of tokens in the conversation does not exceed a certain limit. |
| `ConversationSummaryMemory` | [Link to Migration Guide](conversation_summary_memory) | Continually summarizes the conversation history. The summary is updated after each conversation turn. The abstraction returns the summary of the conversation history. |
| `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` | [Link to Migration Guide](conversation_summary_memory) | Provides a running summary of the conversation together with the most recent messages in the conversation under the constraint that the total number of tokens in the conversation does not exceed a certain limit. |

### 2. Extraction of structured information from the conversation history

Memory classes that fall into this category include:

| Memory Type | Description |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BaseEntityStore` | An abstract interface that resembles a key-value store. It was used for storing structured information learned during the conversation. The information had to be represented as an object of key-value pairs. |

And specific backend implementations of abstractions:

| Memory Type | Description |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `InMemoryEntityStore` | An implementation of `BaseEntityStore` that stores the information in the literal computer memory (RAM). |

These abstractions have not received much development since their initial release. The reason
is that for these abstractions to be useful they typically require a lot of specialization for a particular application, so these
abstractions are not as widely used as the conversation history management abstractions.

For this reason, there are no migration guides for these abstractions. If you're struggling to migrate an application
that relies on these abstractions, please pen an issue on the LangChain GitHub repository, explain your use case, and we'll try to provide more guidance on how to migrate these abstractions.

The general strategy for extracting structured information from the conversation history is to use a chat model with tool calling capabilities to extract structured information from the conversation history.
The extracted information can then be saved into an appropriate data structure (e.g., an object), and information from it can be retrieved and added into the prompt as needed.

### 3. Implementations that provide composite logic on top of one or more memory implementations

Memory classes that fall into this category include:

| Memory Type | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CombinedMemory` | This abstraction accepted a list of `BaseMemory` and fetched relevant memory information from each of them based on the input. |

These implementations did not seem to be used widely or provide significant value. Users should be able
to re-implement these without too much difficulty in custom code.

# LangChain v0.2

LangChain v0.2 was released in May 2024. This release includes a number of breaking changes and deprecations. This document contains a guide on upgrading to 0.2.x, as well as a list of deprecations and breaking changes.

:::note Reference

- [Migrating to Astream Events v2](/docs/versions/v0_2/migrating_astream_events)

:::

## Migration

This documentation will help you upgrade your code to LangChain `0.2.x.`. To prepare for migration, we first recommend you take the following steps:

1. install the 0.2.x versions of `@langchain/core`, langchain and upgrade to recent versions of other packages that you may be using (e.g. `@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/community`, `@langchain/openai`, etc.)
2. Verify that your code runs properly with the new packages (e.g., unit tests pass)
3. Install a recent version of `langchain-cli` , and use the tool to replace old imports used by your code with the new imports. (See instructions below.)
4. Manually resolve any remaining deprecation warnings
5. Re-run unit tests

### Upgrade to new imports

We created a tool to help migrate your code. This tool is still in **beta** and may not cover all cases, but
we hope that it will help you migrate your code more quickly.

The migration script has the following limitations:

1. It's limited to helping users move from old imports to new imports. It doesn't help address other deprecations.
2. It can't handle imports that involve `as` .
3. New imports are always placed in global scope, even if the old import that was replaced was located inside some local scope (e..g, function body).
4. It will likely miss some deprecated imports.

Here is an example of the import changes that the migration script can help apply automatically:

| From Package | To Package | Deprecated Import | New Import |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `langchain` | `@langchain/community` | `import { UpstashVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/upstash"` | `import { UpstashVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash"` |
| `@langchain/community` | `@langchain/openai` | `import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/openai"` | `import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai"` |
| `langchain` | `@langchain/core` | `import { Document } from "langchain/schema/document"` | `import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents"` |
| `langchain` | `@langchain/textsplitters` | `import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter"` | `import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters"` |

#### Deprecation timeline

We have two main types of deprecations:

1. Code that was moved from `langchain` into another package (e.g, `@langchain/community`)

If you try to import it from `langchain`, it will fail since the entrypoint has been removed.

2. Code that has better alternatives available and will eventually be removed, so there's only a single way to do things. (e.g., `predictMessages` method in ChatModels has been deprecated in favor of `invoke`).

Many of these were marked for removal in 0.2. We have bumped the removal to 0.3.

#### Installation

:::note
The 0.2.X migration script is only available in version `0.0.14-rc.1` or later.
:::

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @langchain/scripts@0.0.14-rc.1
```

#### Usage

Given that the migration script is not perfect, you should make sure you have a backup of your code first (e.g., using version control like `git`).

For example, say your code still uses `import ChatOpenAI from "@langchain/community/chat_models/openai";`:

Invoking the migration script will replace this import with `import ChatOpenAI from "@langchain/openai";`.

```typescript
import { updateEntrypointsFrom0_x_xTo0_2_x } from "@langchain/scripts/migrations";

const pathToMyProject = "..."; // This path is used in the following glob pattern: `${projectPath}/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`.

updateEntrypointsFrom0_x_xTo0_2_x({
 projectPath: pathToMyProject,
 shouldLog: true,
});
```

#### Other options

```typescript
updateEntrypointsFrom0_x_xTo0_2_x({
 projectPath: pathToMyProject,
 tsConfigPath: "tsconfig.json", // Path to the tsConfig file. This will be used to load all the project files into the script.
 testRun: true, // If true, the script will not save any changes, but will log the changes that would be made.
 files: ["..."], // A list of .ts file paths to check. If this is provided, the script will only check these files.
});
```
```

# Migrating to streamEvents v2

:::danger

This migration guide is a work in progress and is not complete.

:::

We've added a `v2` of the [`streamEvents`](/docs/how_to/streaming#using-stream-events) API with the release of `0.2.0`. You can see this [PR](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/pull/5539/) for more details.

The `v2` version is a re-write of the `v1` version, and should be more efficient, with more consistent output for the events. The `v1` version of the API will be deprecated in favor of the `v2` version and will be removed in `0.4.0`.

Below is a list of changes between the `v1` and `v2` versions of the API.

### output for `on_chat_model_end`

In `v1`, the outputs associated with `on_chat_model_end` changed depending on whether the
chat model was run as a root level runnable or as part of a chain.

As a root level runnable the output was:

```ts
{
 data: {
 output: AIMessageChunk((content = "hello world!"), (id = "some id"));
 }
}
```

As part of a chain the output was:

```
{
 data: {
 output: {
 generations: [
 [
 {
 generation_info: None,
 message: AIMessageChunk(
 content="hello world!", id="some id"
 ),
 text: "hello world!",
 }
 ]
 ],
 }
 },
}
```

As of `v2`, the output will always be the simpler representation:

```ts
{
 data: {
 output: AIMessageChunk((content = "hello world!"), (id = "some id"));
 }
}
```

:::note
Non chat models (i.e., regular LLMs) will be consistently associated with the more verbose format for now.
:::

### output for `on_retriever_end`

`on_retriever_end` output will always return a list of `Documents`.

This was the output in `v1`:

```ts
{
 data: {
 output: {
 documents: [
 Document(...),
 Document(...),
 ...
 ]
 }
 }
}
```

And here is the new output for `v2`:

```ts
{
 data: {
 output: [
 Document(...),
 Document(...),
 ...
 ]
 }
}
```

### Removed `on_retriever_stream`

The `on_retriever_stream` event was an artifact of the implementation and has been removed.

Full information associated with the event is already available in the `on_retriever_end` event.

Please use `on_retriever_end` instead.

### Removed `on_tool_stream`

The `on_tool_stream` event was an artifact of the implementation and has been removed.

Full information associated with the event is already available in the `on_tool_end` event.

Please use `on_tool_end` instead.

### Propagating Names

Names of runnables have been updated to be more consistent.

If you're filtering by event names, check if you need to update your filters.

# LangChain v0.3

_Last updated: 09.14.24_

## What's changed

- All LangChain packages now have `@langchain/core` as a peer dependency instead of a direct dependency to help avoid type errors around [core version conflicts](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages).
 - You will now need to explicitly install `@langchain/core` rather than relying on an internally resolved version from other packages.
- Callbacks are now backgrounded and non-blocking by default rather than blocking.
 - This means that if you are using e.g. LangSmith for tracing in a serverless environment, you will need to [await the callbacks to ensure they finish before your function ends](/docs/how_to/callbacks_serverless).
- Removed deprecated document loader and self-query entrypoints from `langchain` in favor of entrypoints in [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) and integration packages.
- Removed deprecated Google PaLM entrypoints from community in favor of entrypoints in [`@langchain/google-vertexai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/google-vertexai) and [`@langchain/google-genai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/google-genai).
- Deprecated using objects with a `"type"` as a [`BaseMessageLike`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages.BaseMessageLike.html) in favor of the more OpenAI-like [`MessageWithRole`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/types/_langchain_core.messages.MessageFieldWithRole.html)

## What’s new

The following features have been added during the development of 0.2.x:

- Simplified tool definition and usage. Read more [here](https://blog.langchain.dev/improving-core-tool-interfaces-and-docs-in-langchain/).
- Added a [generalized chat model constructor](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/).
- Added the ability to [dispatch custom events](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/callbacks_custom_events/).
- Released LangGraph.js 0.2.0 and made it the [recommended way to create agents](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent) with LangChain.js.
- Revamped integration docs and API reference. Read more [here](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-integration-docs-revamped/).

## How to update your code

If you're using `langchain` / `@langchain/community` / `@langchain/core` 0.0 or 0.1, we recommend that you first [upgrade to 0.2](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/versions/v0_2/).

If you're using `@langchain/langgraph`, upgrade to `@langchain/langgraph>=0.2.3`. This will work with either 0.2 or 0.3 versions of all the base packages.

Here is a complete list of all packages that have been released and what we recommend upgrading your version constraints to in your `package.json`.
Any package that now supports `@langchain/core` 0.3 had a minor version bump.

### Base packages

| Package | Latest | Recommended `package.json` constraint |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| langchain | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |
| @langchain/community | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |
| @langchain/textsplitters | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/core | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |

### Downstream packages

| Package | Latest | Recommended `package.json` constraint |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| @langchain/langgraph | 0.2.3 | >=0.2.3 <0.3 |

### Integration packages

| Package | Latest | Recommended `package.json` constraint |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| @langchain/anthropic | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |
| @langchain/aws | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/azure-cosmosdb | 0.2.0 | >=0.2.0 <0.3.0 |
| @langchain/azure-dynamic-sessions | 0.2.0 | >=0.2.0 <0.3.0 |
| @langchain/baidu-qianfan | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/cloudflare | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/cohere | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |
| @langchain/exa | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/google-genai | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/google-vertexai | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/google-vertexai-web | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/groq | 0.1.1 | >=0.1.1 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/mistralai | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/mixedbread-ai | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/mongodb | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/nomic | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/ollama | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/openai | 0.3.0 | >=0.3.0 <0.4.0 |
| @langchain/pinecone | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/qdrant | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/redis | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/weaviate | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |
| @langchain/yandex | 0.1.0 | >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 |

Once you've updated to recent versions of the packages, you will need to explicitly install `@langchain/core` if you haven't already:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/core
```

We also suggest checking your lockfile or running the [appropriate package manager command](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages) to make sure that your package manager only has one version of `@langchain/core` installed.

If you are currently running your code in a serverless environment (e.g., a Cloudflare Worker, Edge function, or AWS Lambda function)
and you are using LangSmith tracing or other callbacks, you will need to [await callbacks to ensure they finish before your function ends](/docs/how_to/callbacks_serverless).
Here's a quick example:

```ts
import { RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { awaitAllCallbacks } from "@langchain/core/callbacks/promises";

const runnable = RunnableLambda.from(() => "hello!");

const customHandler = {
 handleChainEnd: async () => {
 await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
 console.log("Call finished");
 },
};

const startTime = new Date().getTime();

await runnable.invoke({ number: "2" }, { callbacks: [customHandler] });

console.log(`Elapsed time: ${new Date().getTime() - startTime}ms`);

await awaitAllCallbacks();

console.log(`Final elapsed time: ${new Date().getTime() - startTime}ms`);
```

```
Elapsed time: 1ms
Call finished
Final elapsed time: 2164ms
```

You can also set `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` to `"false"` to make all callbacks blocking:

```ts
process.env.LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND = "false";

const startTimeBlocking = new Date().getTime();
